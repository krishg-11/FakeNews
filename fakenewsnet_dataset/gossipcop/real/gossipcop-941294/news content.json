And that was the end and I\u2019ve gone on with my life. For it to come back now, it\u2019s a terrible thing to accuse a person of. I\u2019m a man with a family and my own children.\u201d\n\nThe story was resurfaced after allegations were made against Harvey Weinstein and other key figures in Hollywood of sexually predatory behavior. It led to many actors talking about their regret over working with Allen, including Greta Gerwig, Colin Firth and Ellen Page.\n\n\u201cEveryone wants justice to be done,\u201d Allen said. \u201cIf there is something like the #MeToo movement now, you root for them, you want them to bring to justice these terrible harassers, these people who do all these terrible things. And I think that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nBut the 82-year-old is frustrated that his name has been used alongside the men accused of misconduct. He said that the people who have been accused by multiple women shouldn\u2019t be equated with him, as he was \u201conly accused by one woman in a child custody case\u201d and believes he should be heralded as an important ally.\n\n\u201cAs I say, I\u2019m a big advocate of the #MeToo movement,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel when they find people who harass innocent women and men, it\u2019s a good thing that they\u2019re exposing them. But you know I, I should be the poster boy for the #MeToo movement. Because I have worked in movies for 50 years. I\u2019ve worked with hundreds of actresses and not a single one \u2013 big ones, famous ones, ones starting out \u2013 have ever, ever suggested any kind of impropriety at all. I\u2019ve always had a wonderful record with them.\u201d\n\nIn a statement released last year, Allen referred to Weinstein as a \u201csad, sick man\u201d.\n\nLast month saw Allen\u2019s son Moses Farrow defend him in a blogpost, calling his sister\u2019s story a \u201cdiscredited allegation\u201d and accusing his mother, Mia Farrow, of \u201cbrainwashing\u201d and abusive behavior. In response, Dylan Farrow called his words \u201cbeyond hurtful\u201d.\n\nWhen he made similar accusations in a book published in September 2017, Mia Farrow said in a statement: \u201cMoses has cut off his entire family including his ex-wife, who was pregnant when he left. It\u2019s heartbreaking and bewildering that he would make this up, perhaps to please Woody. We all miss and love him very much.\u201d\n\nAllen\u2019s next film, A Rainy Day in New York, faces an uncertain future after stars Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Selena Gomez and Rebecca Hall donated their salaries to various charities. The romantic comedy is yet to receive a release date.", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/077aab1176a35a6c7c8c131be636eeed34cdaf26/272_211_4489_2693/master/4489.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=33678bb2346393de92f5b255bfd9ec56", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Woody+Allen%2CFilm%2C%23MeToo+movement%2CCulture", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/077aab1176a35a6c7c8c131be636eeed34cdaf26/272_211_4489_2693/master/4489.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=9afd50ba57dbfce99bbc59903e16c4af"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/077aab1176a35a6c7c8c131be636eeed34cdaf26/272_211_4489_2693/master/4489.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=9afd50ba57dbfce99bbc59903e16c4af", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Benjamin Lee"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/04/woody-allen-dylan-farrow-metoo-movement-poster-boy", "title": "Woody Allen: 'I should be the poster boy for the #MeToo movement'", "meta_data": {"description": "The writer-director says he supports the campaign and that his \u2018wonderful record\u2019 with women makes him an important ally", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "application-name": "The Guardian", "msapplication-TileColor": "#052962", "theme-color": "#052962", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/023dafadbf5ef53e0865e4baaaa32b3b/windows_tile_144_b.png", "author": "Benjamin Lee", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/077aab1176a35a6c7c8c131be636eeed34cdaf26/272_211_4489_2693/master/4489.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=47665211f72cfa8d899795674b9488f7", "keywords": "Woody Allen,Film,#MeToo movement,Culture", "news_keywords": "Woody Allen,Film,#MeToo movement,Culture", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/04/woody-allen-dylan-farrow-metoo-movement-poster-boy", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/077aab1176a35a6c7c8c131be636eeed34cdaf26/272_211_4489_2693/master/4489.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=9afd50ba57dbfce99bbc59903e16c4af", "description": "The writer-director says he supports the campaign and that his \u2018wonderful record\u2019 with women makes him an important ally", "type": "article", "title": "Woody Allen: 'I should be the poster boy for the #MeToo movement'", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/benjamin-lee-film", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "Film", "published_time": "2018-06-04T17:02:36.000Z", "tag": "Woody Allen,Film,#MeToo movement,Culture", "modified_time": "2018-06-04T17:27:37.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://film/2018/jun/04/woody-allen-dylan-farrow-metoo-movement-poster-boy?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287, "pages": 516977308337360}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://film/2018/jun/04/woody-allen-dylan-farrow-metoo-movement-poster-boy?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/04/woody-allen-dylan-farrow-metoo-movement-poster-boy", "iphone": "gnmguardian://film/2018/jun/04/woody-allen-dylan-farrow-metoo-movement-poster-boy?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/077aab1176a35a6c7c8c131be636eeed34cdaf26/272_211_4489_2693/master/4489.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=341c1aa6e699d4c5e839f866c4360727", "site": "@guardian", "card": "summary_large_image", "dnt": "on"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528084800.0, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com", "summary": ""}
