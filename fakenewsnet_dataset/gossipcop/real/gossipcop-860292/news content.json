Together, the two discussed Perry\u2019s desire to be live an more genuine life \u2014 something she\u2019d been inspired to do after drawing an \u201cauthenticity\u201d card from a desk of inspirational Angel Cards in the wake of her last album, 2013\u2019s Prism.\n\nImage zoom Katy Perry/Youtube\n\nAttempting to leave behind the heightened pop persona that catapulted the \u201cCalifornia Girls\u201d singer into stardom, Perry told Dr. Singh that she often feels divided between \u201cKaty Perry, pop star\u201d and \u201cKatheryn Hudson,\u201d the \u201cdork\u201d her family and close friends know.\n\nThe dichotomy is part of the reason Perry decided to embark on such a drastic pixie haircut. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to look like Katy Perry anymore,\u201d she said \u2014 adding that the haircut had provoked hate and abuse from users on social media.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a bit more nerdy than everybody thinks I am, I\u2019m a big goofball. The fantasy of Katheryn went into Katy and made this bigger than life personality,\u201d Perry said, Australia\u2019s News Corp reported. \u201cThat\u2019s the point of this whole thing, if people can see I\u2019m just like them then they can dream just as big,\u201d\n\nTears (and mascara) running down her face, Perry also opened up about her past battles with alcohol \u2014 admitting that she had struggled with thoughts of suicide in the past, according to News Corp.\n\n\u201cI wrote a song about it,\u201d she said according to News Corp. \u201cI feel ashamed that I would have those thoughts, feel that low and that depressed.\u201d\n\nShe reportedly added: \u201cYou can be right or you can be loved. I just want to be loved.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59d6486f5205aabdbf65fd1a39fa97ee?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/katy-perry6.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/katy-perry6.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/trax-perry.jpg"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/katy-perry6.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Quinn"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/celebrity/katy-perry-therapy-session-livestream-suicide/", "title": "Katy Perry Breaks Down in Shockingly Honest Therapy Session as She Opens Up About Past Suicidal Thoughts", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Katy Perry, Katy Perry Witness, Katy Perry new album, Katy Perry therapy, Katy Perry crying, Katy Perry cries, Katy Perry tear, Katy Perry tearful, Katy Perry the therapist, Katy Perry real name, Katy Perry YouTube, Katy Perry livestream", "news_keywords": "Katy Perry, Katy Perry Witness, Katy Perry new album, Katy Perry therapy, Katy Perry crying, Katy Perry cries, Katy Perry tear, Katy Perry tearful, Katy Perry the therapist, Katy Perry real name, Katy Perry YouTube, Katy Perry livestream", "description": "Katy Perry\u00a0gave fans witness to an emotional and raw therapy session on Friday night, where she discussed everything from her past struggles with alcohol and suicide to the real motivation behind her pixie haircut", "og": {"title": "Katy Perry Breaks Down in Shockingly Honest Therapy Session as She Opens Up About Past Suicidal Thoughts", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/celebrity/katy-perry-therapy-session-livestream-suicide/", "description": "Katy Perry\u00a0gave fans witness to an emotional and raw therapy session on Friday night, where she discussed everything from her past struggles with alcohol and suicide to the real motivation behind her pixie haircut", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/katy-perry6.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/celebrity/katy-perry-therapy-session-livestream-suicide/", "description": "Katy Perry\u00a0gave fans witness to an emotional and raw therapy session on Friday night, where she discussed everything from her past struggles with alcohol and suicide to the real motivation behind her pixie haircut", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/katy-perry6.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/celebrity/katy-perry-therapy-session-livestream-suicide/", "title": "Katy Perry Breaks Down in Shockingly Honest Therapy Session as She Opens Up About Past Suicidal Thoughts", "description": "Katy Perry\u00a0gave fans witness to an emotional and raw therapy session on Friday night, where she discussed everything from her past struggles with alcohol and suicide to the real motivation behind her pixie haircut", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/katy-perry6.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/uBj0qJ6bcIg"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
