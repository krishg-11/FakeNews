This time, however, she did so accompanied by Jimmy Fallon and The Roots on Nintendo Labo\u2018s line of cardboard instruments.\n\nIt feels like a twist on Fallon\u2019s Classroom Instruments bit.\n\nWith Nintendo Labo, Nintendo Switch players can create their own instruments using cardboard sheets combined with their detachable controllers. So with Fallon on the guitar-piano studio and Questlove on robot kit, the late-night TV band was able to lay down some backup for Grande.\n\nThe pop singer appeared on The Tonight Show\u2018s May 1 episode for its entire duration. It was there she performed \u201cNo Tears Left to Cry\u201d for the first time on television, after dropping it days earlier and surprising the Coachella audience with a performance of the single.\n\nNow watch the Nintendo Labo rendition above.", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2a147acd56f71c458ad74777cefaea83?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/nup_182848_5000.jpg?crop=0px%2C243px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/nup_182848_5000.jpg?crop=0px%2C243px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nick Romano"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/05/15/ariana-grande-no-tears-left-to-cry-jimmy-fallon-nintendo-labo/", "title": "Ariana Grande performs new single with Jimmy Fallon's Nintendo Labo instruments", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Ariana Grande,Jimmy Fallon,Last Night on Late Night", "news_keywords": "Ariana Grande,Jimmy Fallon,Last Night on Late Night", "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lY1GXTu5M Ariana Grande returned to The Tonight Show this week to perform her new single, \"No Tears Left to Cry,\"\u2026", "og": {"title": "Ariana Grande performs new single with Jimmy Fallon's Nintendo Labo instruments", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/05/15/ariana-grande-no-tears-left-to-cry-jimmy-fallon-nintendo-labo/", "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lY1GXTu5M Ariana Grande returned to The Tonight Show this week to perform her new single, \"No Tears Left to Cry,\"\u2026", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/nup_182848_5000.jpg?crop=0px%2C243px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/05/15/ariana-grande-no-tears-left-to-cry-jimmy-fallon-nintendo-labo/", "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lY1GXTu5M Ariana Grande returned to The Tonight Show this week to perform her new single, \"No Tears Left to Cry,\"\u2026", "media": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/nup_182848_5000.jpg?crop=0px%2C243px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/05/15/ariana-grande-no-tears-left-to-cry-jimmy-fallon-nintendo-labo/", "title": "Ariana Grande performs new single with Jimmy Fallon's Nintendo Labo instruments", "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lY1GXTu5M Ariana Grande returned to The Tonight Show this week to perform her new single, \"No Tears Left to Cry,\"\u2026", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/nup_182848_5000.jpg?crop=0px%2C243px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/m6lY1GXTu5M"], "publish_date": 1526356800.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
