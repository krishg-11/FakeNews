Whether they're walking down the street or stepping onto the red carpet, these women always look great. And this time is no different. Kendall Jenner wore a crystal dress to the 2017 Met Gala. As in, it was made out of nothing but 85,000 crystals. It comes as no surprise that she nailed yet another red carpet ensemble, but this might just be her most unconventional look yet.\n\nThe model typically sticks to cutouts on the Met Gala red carpet. It seems like every year the cutouts get more and more intricate too. But, with this year's theme being Rei Kawakubo \u2014 aka all about the fabric \u2014 Jenner amped up her look to do the exact opposite. She stepped onto the red carpet in a La Perla Haute Couture Collection gown designed by Creative Director Julia Haart that was made but nothing but 85,000 hand painted and placed crystals. Basically, it's the chicest net you'll ever see walk the red carpet.\n\nJenner kept the rest of the look simple. Because when you're wearing nothing but accessories, you don't need to wear any. This look is definitely a piece of art to say the least. But don't just take me word for it. Here's the full head-to-toe look, so you can take it all in.\n\nNeilson Barnard/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nThis entire dress was one big accessory! It doesn't get more gorgeous than that.\n\nTheo Wargo/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nJenner can rock anything, and she wears this crystalized dress like a pro.\n\nTheo Wargo/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nBecause clothing is overrated.", "images": ["https://imgix.bustle.com/2017/5/2/675604606.jpg?w=646&fit=max&auto=format&q=70", "https://imgix.bustle.com/2017/5/2/675595720.jpg?w=646&fit=max&auto=format&q=70", "https://imgix.bustle.com/2017/5/2/675604752.jpg?w=646&fit=max&auto=format&q=70", "https://imgix.bustle.com/2017/5/2/675604234.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17519299&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/2017/5/2/675604234.jpg?w=970&h=546&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/2017/5/2/675604234.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bustle.com/p/kendall-jenners-2017-met-gala-dress-was-made-with-85000-crystals-zero-fabric-54730", "title": "Kendall Jenner\u2019s 2017 Met Gala Dress Was Made With 85,000 Crystals & Zero Fabric", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@bustle", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"site_name": "Bustle", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/kendall-jenners-2017-met-gala-dress-was-made-with-85000-crystals-zero-fabric-54730", "type": "article", "title": "Kendall Jenner Wore 85,000 Crystals To The Met Gala", "description": "If there's anyone that knows how to make a sartorial statement, it the Kardashian-Jenner family.
