The 44-year-old actor has two daughters and believes that being a dad is \u201cthe greatest blessing.\u201d \u201cI realized being a father is the greatest job I have ever had and the greatest job I will ever have,\u201d he said on \u201cOprah\u2019s Master Class\u201d in 2015, before his second daughter was born. \u201cThroughout the years, throughout the ups and downs, I\u2019ve realized that the most important thing that I could do with my daughter is lead our life with love,\u201d he said. \u201cNot success, not fame, not anything else but, \u2018I\u2019m always here for you. I love you.\u2019\u201d The Rock had his first daughter, 15-year-old Simone, during his first marriage to Dany Garcia. He then welcomed his second daughter, one-year-old Jasmine, in December 2015 with his longtime partner Lauren Hashian. Since having kids, Johnson has proven time and again that he is the sweetest dad. Here, we round up The Rock\u2019s cutest moments with his girls. 1. When he celebrated Jasmine\u2019s four month birthday with the sweetest message.\n\n\u201cI'm always asked - What inspires YOU?\u201d he wrote on Instagram last year. \u201cMy answer's easy and honest.. what inspires me the most is always waitin' for me to walk thru my front door when I come home.\u201d 2. When he got teary-eyed talking about Simone.\n\nOn an episode of \u201cOprah\u2019s Master Class\u201d in 2015, Johnson recalled a time he asked his teen daughter, \u201cWhat is the thing that you love most about our relationship?\u201d \u201cShe said, \u2018Well, that I trust you,\u2019\u201d he said, tearing up. \u201cFor a 13-year-old girl to say that to her dad... She said, \u2018I trust you, and we have a very special bond.\u2019 And that moved me. At 13, she\u2019s saying that and, you know, I couldn\u2019t ask for anything else. I love that girl.\u201d 3. When he danced around in a Pikachu costume to make Jasmine happy.\n\nEven though The Rock was tired and sweating, he kept on dancing just to make his baby girl smile. \u201cIt\u2019s what daddies do,\u201d he said in the video. Cue the \"awws.\" 4. When he praised the remarkable father-daughter bond he shares with Simone.\n\nA photo posted by therock (@therock) on Oct 21, 2016 at 12:56am PDT\n\n\u201cIt's the most unique, powerful, loving, irreplaceable, one-of-a-kind bond on earth. The bond between a father and his daughter,\u201d Johnson wrote on Instagram in October. \u201cSo proud [of] you [Simone] for the young woman you've become and so grateful for the bond we have. I take complete credit for your wit and charm. All that brains and beauty you got go to your mama.\u201d 5. When he sang \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to his baby girl and got completely ignored.\n\nTeaching 'em young to start applauding the moment daddy starts singing. Smart girl. Answering my egotistical questions is clearly a work in progress;). Happy 1st Birthday baby girl. Got you for life. #Aiga #PuaMana\ud83c\udf3a A video posted by therock (@therock) on Dec 16, 2016 at 8:29pm PST\n\n6. When he and Simone made the perfect pair at the 2016 Golden Globes...\n\n\"Let's roll baby..\" #MinutesAway #RedCarpet #GoldenGlobes A video posted by therock (@therock) on Jan 10, 2016 at 4:00pm PST\n\nAnd again at the 2017 People's Choice Awards.\n\nDwayne Johnson and Simone Alexandra Johnson attend the People's Choice Awards 2017 at Microsoft Theater on January 18, 2017 in Los Angeles, California. 7. When he gave his baby girl sound advice\u2026 and she pooped on him.\n\nA photo posted by therock (@therock) on Sep 5, 2016 at 9:19am PDT\n\n\u201cI had an amazing philosophical conversation w/ my baby girl about the value of hard work and how respect is given when it's earned,\u201d the dad shared on Instagram last year. \u201cI told her, \u2018Baby girl when you grow up, you get out there and dent the universe thru hard work and sweat. And always make sure you do it in a positive way with class, dignity and respect.\u2019 \u201cShe responded by poo'ing on me in this moment as she plays her favourite game, \u2018Drum time on daddy's big head.\u2019 It was a good talk.\u201d 8. When he took time during a photo-op to try and embarrass his daughter.\n\nFresh off the #MrOlympia stage.. bringin' my Man of The Century ICON award AND my baby girl @simonealex_ back home. #LuckyDad #AGoodTimeFlex #AndEmbarrassMyDaughter\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udcaf A photo posted by therock (@therock) on Sep 17, 2016 at 10:47pm PDT\n\nShe wasn't even fazed. 9. When he accessorized with his baby girl.\n\nSwoon. 10. And finally, every time he puts his blended family first.", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5deec1df210000f90134f78b.jpeg?cache=Jwl47Q4j9J&ops=150_150",
