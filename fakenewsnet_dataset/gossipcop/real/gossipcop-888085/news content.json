They were then \u201cwhisked up to the Queen\u2019s private sitting room\u201d for the hour-long meeting, Kay reports. (We assume her no-fail, go-to jeans were not her choice of attire for this particular occasion!)\n\nImage zoom Splash News Online\n\nLater that evening, Harry was in top form as he accepted a posthumous award honoring the HIV/AIDS activism of his mother, Princess Diana, at the Attitude magazine awards.\n\nSpokespeople at Kensington Palace and Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the report.\n\nThere is critical significance in Markle\u2019s meeting with the Queen. Harry is fifth in the line of succession (he\u2019ll be pushed to sixth after William and Kate welcome their third baby this spring), meaning he has to have the monarch\u2019s permission to wed.\n\nThere had been rumors that the Suits star and the Queen may have met earlier \u2014 during a visit to Balmoral Castle in Scotland.\n\nLast month, Harry, 33, and Meghan, 36, made their public debut as a couple at the Invictus Games in Toronto, where they held hands at a wheelchair tennis event and spent time with her mom, Doria. Before the games, Markle had spoken in a way that no other royal girlfriend or boyfriend had done so before, saying they were \u201ctwo people who are really happy and in love.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Karwai Tang/WireImage\n\nAnd if there is any doubt that Harry would need to worry about securing his grandmother\u2019s approval, one inside source tells PEOPLE he would be in the clear. \u201cIf Harry asks for something, she would say yes as she adores him,\u201d the source says.\n\nIf they are to wed, there are suggestions it would take place at St. George\u2019s Chapel at Windsor Castle.\n\nLast week was a busy one for the royals: The Queen, 91, returned from her annual Scottish summer getaway, and Harry helped host a party for mental health professionals in the palace on Tuesday. This week has been active as well, with Harry joining his grandmother on Tuesday for a private reception of the Queen\u2019s Commonwealth Trust, a fledgling charity. Harry \u2013 who features on the organization\u2019s new website \u2014 has taken a prominent role in several projects for the Commonwealth, especially based around young people and the environment.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/meghan-markle2.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/meghan-markle3.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1250px%2C656.25px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3d474783f251ae29579c66da81f73439?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/gettyimages-856089924.jpg"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/meghan-markle3.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1250px%2C656.25px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Simon Perry"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/royals/prince-harry-takes-meghan-markle-for-tea-at-the-palace-to-meet-queen-elizabeth-report/", "title": "Prince Harry Takes Meghan Markle for Tea at the Palace to Meet Queen Elizabeth: Report", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Meghan Markle, Prince Harry, Suits, Buckingham Palace, Queen Elizabeth, royals, royal engagement", "news_keywords": "Meghan Markle, Prince Harry, Suits, Buckingham Palace, Queen Elizabeth, royals, royal engagement", "description": "In another big step in their relationship, the actress was discreetly ushered into the palace last week, a new report says", "og": {"title": "Prince Harry Takes Meghan Markle for Tea at the Palace to Meet Queen Elizabeth: Report", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/royals/prince-harry-takes-meghan-markle-for-tea-at-the-palace-to-meet-queen-elizabeth-report/", "description": "In another big step in their relationship, the actress was discreetly ushered into the palace last week, a new report says", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/meghan-markle3.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1250px%2C656.25px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/royals/prince-harry-takes-meghan-markle-for-tea-at-the-palace-to-meet-queen-elizabeth-report/", "description": "In another big step in their relationship, the actress was discreetly ushered into the palace last week, a new report says", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/meghan-markle3.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1250px%2C656.25px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/royals/prince-harry-takes-meghan-markle-for-tea-at-the-palace-to-meet-queen-elizabeth-report/", "title": "Prince Harry Takes Meghan Markle for Tea at the Palace to Meet Queen Elizabeth: Report", "description": "In another big step in their relationship, the actress was discreetly ushered into the palace last week, a new report says", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/meghan-markle3.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1250px%2C656.25px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
