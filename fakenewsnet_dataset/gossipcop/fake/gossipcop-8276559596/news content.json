The show, titled Gwen Stefani \u2014 Just a Girl, is good. In fact, it\u2019s hella good.\n\n\u201cThis is a crazy night, okay, because this is the first night. I\u2019ll remember this for the rest of my life, so you guys have a huge responsibility,\u201d she told the sold-out crowd early into the show. \u201cThis is going to be an epic night tonight.\u201d\n\nOver the course of 100 minutes, Stefani sang her biggest hits, touching on songs from her solo career and her career with No Doubt. When Stefani announced the show in April she promised that the residency show would be b-a-n-a-n-a-s, and it was\u2026 literally. The first song of the show \u2014 \u201cHollaback Girl\u201d \u2014 featured her dancers carrying oversized bananas.\n\nImage zoom Gwen Stefani Todd Stefani\n\nImage zoom Gwen Stefani Todd Stefani\n\nImage zoom Gwen Stefani Todd Stefani\n\nImage zoom Gwen Stefani performs the debut date of her Las Vegas residency on June 27, 2018. Splash News\n\nDuring other songs, such as \u201cSimple Kind of Life,\u201d Stefani wore a makeshift wedding dress, and she harkened back to her ska roots with \u201cSunday Morning,\u201d donning a midriff-bearing shirt and plaid pants.\n\nStefani wasn\u2019t afraid to incorporate her love life into the show either. In fact, she seemed to pay homage to boyfriend Blake Shelton as she dressed in a cowgirl outfit for \u201cMake Me Like You,\u201d a song she\u2019s said is about her beau.\n\nImage zoom Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton at the debut of her Las Vegas residency on June 27, 2018. Gabe Ginsberg/FilmMagic\n\nShelton, as expected, was in attendance, even getting a standing ovation when he walked into the theater before settling in with Stefani\u2019s 4-year-old son Apollo in his lap.\n\n\u201cI see a lot of admiring eyes on my sparkles. I know, it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Stefani said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to wear a cowgirl costume right in front of Blake Shelton. It\u2019s like my fantasy come true.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Gwen Stefani Todd Stefani\n\nAfter all the costume changes and the hits, the show at its core was, pardon the pun, a sweet escape. But, not only did Stefani give fans a musical trip down memory lane, but she gave her fans a deep dive into her personal life.\n\nDuring an interlude, Stefani spoke of her younger self, saying she envisioned herself with several kids and a \u201cperfect family.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something I dreamed of for a long time,\u201d she said in a video during the show. \u201cBut, my own love life experience wasn\u2019t what I thought it would be, and I feel like I had so much love to give inside me, but I was unlucky in love, which has been a blessing because I\u2019ve been able to write about that and share that and have this incredibly blessed musical career.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cThere was a point in my life where I felt that I was losing everything \u2026 When I look back at all the times my heart was broken, it was always music that healed me.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Blake Shelton with Gwen Stefani's son, Apollo.
