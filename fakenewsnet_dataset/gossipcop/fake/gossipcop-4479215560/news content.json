George Clooney, Oprah Winfrey, and Sir Elton John were just a few of the many celebs in attendance to witness the blessed event.\n\nPrior to the nuptials, Markle\u2019s friend Serena Williams tweeted out a few shots of her and hubby Alex Ohanian all decked out in their formal attire. \u201cReady for my friend\u2019s wedding,\u201d tweeted the tennis superstar.\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex\u2019s former Suits costar (and onscreen love interest) Patrick J. Adams also made the guest list, but posted a special message for the bride the night before.\n\nGoing to bed now and thinking a lot about the strange surreal and wonderful day my friend Meghan is going to have tomorrow. Meghan \u2013 wherever you are \u2013 we are so grateful to be here to watch you both take this monumental step together. Love deeply and live well. #RoyalWedding \u2014 Patrick J Adams (@halfadams) May 18, 2018\n\nOf course, many more celebs and other personalities were either covering the festivities in England for various media outlets or watching the celebration from the comfort of their couches. It clearly was not as good as being there, but it was much easier for those who did not score invites to share their thoughts regarding the royal wedding on social media. See what they had to say below:\n\nWhat a fairytale #royalwedding for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.
