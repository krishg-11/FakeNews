A so-called \u201csource\u201d tells the magazine, \u201cMariah was hanging all over French. She sat on his lap, and at one point they even kissed! They weren\u2019t trying to hide their PDA.\u201d\n\nA new tabloid report says there was heavy flirting going on between Mariah Carey and French Montana when the two recently collaborated in the recording studio. Gossip Cop looked into this claim about a possible hookup between the music artists, and we\u2019ve exclusively learned the truth.\n\nThe outlet\u2019s dubious insider goes on to say the rapper \u201cwas loving all the attention from Mariah,\u201d who allegedly \u201cjumped on French\u2019s back as he carried her around.\u201d The seemingly phony source further alleges the pair \u201cleft the studio together\u201d when they finished recording and \u201cdefinitely weren\u2019t trying to hide anything.\u201d\n\nOf course, it\u2019s common practice for the tabloids to romantically link musicians of the opposite sex who collaborate together, so Gossip Cop was hesitant to believe this latest alleged fling. Our doubts were confirmed after checking in with a rep for Carey, who exclusively tells us the outlet\u2019s report is entirely \u201cfalse.\u201d We\u2019re assured the singer wasn\u2019t flirting with her colleague, nor did the two go home together.\n\nNaturally, Life & Style isn\u2019t the best source when it comes to finding accurate news about the singer. Gossip Cop previously busted the tabloid for making up a story about Carey hiring a speech therapist to teach her to speak with a British accent. GC also corrected the magazine after it falsely claimed Carey gives money to boyfriend Bryan Tanaka so he can buy her gifts. The publication\u2019s latest article suggesting Carey and Montana are more than just collaborators is equally bogus.\n\nPhoto: AOL", "images": ["https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/5d2f2cf1c06cc9bd1839deba?ops=gravity(%22center%22),maxcontain(158,100),quality(90)", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=270798540384083&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/5d2f2cf1c06cc9bd1839deba?ops=gravity(%22center%22),maxcontain(96,60)", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6036262&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/3d87b979-b07b-4349-894d-492d922dea2c", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wOC8yNS81OWEwOTMzYjFkZTVhMTI5NzQ1YTRkMjYvNTlhMDkzM2IwYzJhZmYzMGZlZjFmYjMyX29fRl92MC5qcGc=", "http://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/57d1caf936ce620b3fa9e66f"], "top_img": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wOC8yNS81OWEwOTMzYjFkZTVhMTI5NzQ1YTRkMjYvNTlhMDkzM2IwYzJhZmYzMGZlZjFmYjMyX29fRl92MC5qcGc=", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrew Shuster"], "canonical_link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-09-12-mariah-carey-french-montana-did-not-flirt-in-recording-studio/", "title": "Mariah Carey & French Montana Did NOT Flirt In Recording Studio", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Carey and Montana recently worked together on a remix of his hit single \u201cUnforgettable.\u201d", "thumbnail": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wOC8yNS81OWEwOTMzYjFkZTVhMTI5NzQ1YTRkMjYvNTlhMDkzM2IwYzJhZmYzMGZlZjFmYjMyX29fRl92MC5qcGc=", "keywords": "Mariah Carey (31885),French Montana (281545)", "og": {"title": "Mariah Carey & French Montana Did NOT Flirt In Recording Studio | Queen's Feast: Charlotte Restaurant Week", "type": "article", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wOC8yNS81OWEwOTMzYjFkZTVhMTI5NzQ1YTRkMjYvNTlhMDkzM2IwYzJhZmYzMGZlZjFmYjMyX29fRl92MC5qcGc=", "url": "https://charlotterestaurantweek.iheart.com/content/2017-09-12-mariah-carey-french-montana-did-not-flirt-in-recording-studio/", "description": "Carey and Montana recently worked together on a remix of his hit single \u201cUnforgettable.\u201d", "site_name": "Queen's Feast: Charlotte Restaurant Week", "locale": "en_US"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://charlotterestaurantweek.iheart.com/content/2017-09-12-mariah-carey-french-montana-did-not-flirt-in-recording-studio/", "site": "@QueensFeast", "creator": "@QueensFeast", "description": "Carey and Montana recently worked together on a remix of his hit single \u201cUnforgettable.\u201d", "title": "Mariah Carey & French Montana Did NOT Flirt In Recording Studio | Queen's Feast: Charlotte Restaurant Week", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wOC8yNS81OWEwOTMzYjFkZTVhMTI5NzQ1YTRkMjYvNTlhMDkzM2IwYzJhZmYzMGZlZjFmYjMyX29fRl92MC5qcGc=", "domain": "charlotterestaurantweek.iheart.com"}, "parsely-title": "Mariah Carey & French Montana Did NOT Flirt In Recording Studio | Queen's Feast: Charlotte Restaurant Week", "parsely-link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-09-12-mariah-carey-french-montana-did-not-flirt-in-recording-studio/", "parsely-image-url": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wOC8yNS81OWEwOTMzYjFkZTVhMTI5NzQ1YTRkMjYvNTlhMDkzM2IwYzJhZmYzMGZlZjFmYjMyX29fRl92MC5qcGc=", "parsely-tags": "Mariah Carey (31885),French Montana (281545)", "parsely-type": "post", "application-name": "Queen's Feast: Charlotte Restaurant Week", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wOC8yNS81OWEwOTMzYjFkZTVhMTI5NzQ1YTRkMjYvNTlhMDkzM2IwYzJhZmYzMGZlZjFmYjMyX29fRl92MC5qcGc=", "google-site-verification": "p2FWrUKxtwBmQgHV4CjD80oKdZZBjmMNByoWvZMsYso", "msvalidate.01": "E98E323249F89ACF6294F958692E230B", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "fb": {"pages": 106038777280}, "parsely-pub-date": "2017-09-12 09:54:00-04:00", "parsely-author": "Andrew Shuster", "parsely-section": "National - Trending (CHR Rhythmic) (501919)"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505188800.0, "source": "http://charlotterestaurantweek.iheart.com", "summary": ""}
