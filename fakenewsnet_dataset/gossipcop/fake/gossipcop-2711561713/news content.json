She\u2019s this wonderful, elegant person,\u201d Anna Kendrick (as Stephanie) says of Lively\u2019s character in the preview, which the latter debuted Wednesday morning via her Twitter account. Crazy Rich Asians star Henry Golding, who plays Emily\u2019s husband, Sean, continues: \u201cShe is an enigma, my wife. You can get close to her, but never quite reach her.\u201d\n\nAs quick flashes of police sirens, a violent car crash, and deliciously smirky glances flash onscreen, Emily reminds us: \u201cEverybody has a dark side. Some of us are better at hiding it than others.\u201d\n\nThe biggest reveal the trailer presents, however, is Emily grinning in a crimson wig after Stephanie explains: \u201cFive days ago, Emily went missing. I\u2019m realizing I don\u2019t know her as well as I thought I did. Emily, if you\u2019re out there, we\u2019re all really worried!\u201d\n\nIn anticipation of the trailer\u2019s release, Lively sent fans into a tizzy Monday by deleting all of her Instagram posts save for a single photo of a hangman-style game which spelled out the question, \u201cWhat happened to Emily?\u201d As of Wednesday, Lively unfollowed most of the accounts she previously tracked, and is now following only women named Emily Nelson \u2014 37 of them, to be exact.\n\nA Simple Favor \u2014 also starring Rupert Friend, Jean Smart, Linda Cardellini, Andrew Rannells, and Sarah Baker \u2014 is set for release on Sept. 14.
