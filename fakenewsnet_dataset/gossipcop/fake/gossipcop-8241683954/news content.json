On Sunday night, they shared a late dinner date with Thompson\u2019s friends at the popular restaurant BOA in West Hollywood, where Kardashian was seen wearing what looks to be a huge diamond engagement-like ring on her left hand, in photos first obtained by TMZ.\n\n\u201cKhlo\u00e9 looked great,\u201d a source tells PEOPLE, \u201cShe wore a huge, new ring.\u201d\n\nKardashian was quick to clap back at reports that she and Tristan were not getting along, writing on Twitter that as a new mom she\u2019s \u201ctired AF\u201d and \u201cbeing out past 10 pm is not where I\u2019ll have the most energy these days.\u201d She also said she\u2019d \u201crather stay home\u201d with her daughter.\n\nYou make up anything!! I actually had a great night. It was a large birthday dinner for friends and as a new mom IM TIRED AF!! Being out past 10pm is not where I\u2019ll have the most energy these days. https://t.co/mUMnvKdLno \u2014 Khlo\u00e9 (@khloekardashian) June 25, 2018\n\nMy little mama goes to bed at 8. So I have a few hours to enjoy \u201cbeing an adult\u201d but truthfully I would rather just stay home with her. But I tried last night lol https://t.co/ucoJdIOzFI \u2014 Khlo\u00e9 (@khloekardashian) June 25, 2018\n\nIt remains unclear if Kardashian\u2019s new bling is in fact an engagement ring, or maybe even an early present from Thompson leading up to her 34th birthday on Wednesday.\n\nFor her big night out, \u201cTrue\u2019s mom\u201d wore a tight black top, camo jacket and her hair in a sleek half-up hairstyle with textured waves. She did cover her left hand in an Instagram photo she shared Tuesday.\n\nSince the couple\u2019s return to L.A., a source told PEOPLE that they \u201cseem to be in the best place they\u2019ve been since the scandal.\u201d\n\n\u201cKhlo\u00e9\u2019s super family-focused and wants to keep her family together. The focus is on their newborn daughter,\u201d the source shared, adding, \u201cTristan\u2019s been supportive and helping out when he can. No one was anticipating he was going to come out with her and that they would be so public last night.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian & Tristan Thompson Grab Fast Food as It\u2019s Revealed They\u2019re in the \u2018Best Place\u2019\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian Slams Claims She\u2019s on a \u2018Ridiculous\u2019 Post-Baby Diet After Showing Off Weight Loss\n\nSources have also told PEOPLE that the couple will spend the summer in L.A. with their newborn daughter \u2014 who was born just two days after allegations surfaced that Thompson cheated on Kardashian throughout her pregnancy \u2014 and will return to Cleveland when Thompson\u2019s basketball season starts up again.\n\nRELATED: New Mom Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian\u2019s Heartbreak: Everything We Know About Tristan Thompson\u2019s Cheating Scandal\n\nAs for Kardashian\u2019s protective family members, an insider told PEOPLE they \u201crespect her decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone knows Khlo\u00e9 plans on staying with Tristan, so things have been civil so far,\u201d the source said. \u201cThey still have opinions about Tristan\u2019s bad behavior, of course, but no one wants to upset Khlo\u00e9.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/khloe-kardashian-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C41px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/khloe-kardashian-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C41px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brittany Talarico"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/style/khloe-kardashian-wears-engagement-like-ring-date-with-tristan-thompson/", "title": "Are Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian and Tristan Thompson Engaged?
