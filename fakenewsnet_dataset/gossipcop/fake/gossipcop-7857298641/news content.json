I wrote a fan-fic about how they can do it with the Flashpoint movie, but nowhere did I confirm it. After Variety came out with news about the reconstruction of executive roles behind the screen of DCFU and so-called confirmation of Affleck leaving the role, fans have been speculating who should wear the cowl next. Now, the news of Ben wanting to leave Batman\u2019s role isn\u2019t new and many actors names to replace him have surfaced time and again. But a few days ago I saw an article from one of the popular websites that claimed that Jon Hamm wants to steal Ben Affleck\u2019s Batman role.\n\nIt stated that \u2013\n\nJon\u2019s gunning hard for the role. They\u2019ve (Ben and Jon) enjoyed working together and have been on good terms ever since. But Jon knows Ben has faced some criticism over Batman v Superman and Justice League and frankly thinks he\u2019d be better suited for the job. This is business for Jon, not personal\n\nAnd no matter how exciting it may sound to Hamm\u2019s fans, according to me, the facts that I have gathered so far appear to confirm that it\u2019s a big fat lie.\n\nJon doesn\u2019t even want a Superhero role, leave aside Batman.\n\nDuring an interview with The Radio Times in 2014, Hamm was asked whether he\u2019d ever been offered a role in a superhero film. The actor stated that he\u2019d been offered several, but made the \u201cright decision\u201d in turning them down. He didn\u2019t disclose what these parts were but described these types of movie deals as \u201cdraconian.\u201d\n\nHe specifically said \u2013\n\nFor me to sign on now to do a superhero movie would mean I would be working until I am fifty as that particular superhero. It\u2019s a lot of work at one thing, which is not necessarily the reason I got into the business \u2013 which is to do many things. If you want to spend all day pressing the same key that\u2026 seems an odd choice\n\nNow it may seem old talk, but I don\u2019t think that Jonn will change his mind and become so desperate for a superhero role. This just proves what a false argument those websites presented when they went for Jon Hamm becoming desperate for comic book character without having a glimpse of his past statements.\n\nOne rumour contradicts the other.\n\nIt\u2019s so disheartening to know that people with power and sources today exploit the innocent. These news websites come out with new rumours every other day which are more bogus than the previous. A few days ago we got a rumour that Matt Reeves is looking for a younger actor to play Batman in his trilogy. And now we are getting another rumour that an actor who\u2019s older than Affleck is being considered for the role. Obviously, both the rumours are contradicting one another implying that one of them is definitely false.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Do you think Jon, after stating that he doesn\u2019t want to be a part of superhero franchise would ask for the Batman role? Tell us in the comments.
