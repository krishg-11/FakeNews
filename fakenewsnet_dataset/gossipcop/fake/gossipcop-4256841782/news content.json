The day marked Fox\u2019s first (and only) celebrity wedding. While it was originally planned as a big October wedding at the Bacara in Santa Barbara, things rapidly changed after the paparazzi figured out the date and location. Fox was left with about 10 days to organize a completely new, surprise wedding \u2014 and, not trusting any other venue to keep the secret, she held it at her own house.\n\nMost Britney fans probably don\u2019t celebrate her short-lived marriage\u2019s anniversary; some even see it as a key moment in a downward spiral from which she has only recently recovered. Still, though Britney filed for divorce in 2006, Fox holds that marriage dear.\n\nGet The Brief. Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Did you think that this would be one of the biggest weddings-\n\nAlyson Fox: \u2014of my career? Yes, I mean, she is Britney Spears. I first interviewed with Felicia, her assistant for years, and I didn\u2019t know who I was meeting with, just that it was a VIP\u2026 I met Britney and her mom the next day and they all couldn\u2019t be nicer. The sweetest. I mean they\u2019re from the South. Britney\u2019s so polite, she kept calling me Miss Alyson, and I was like, \u2018Oh my God don\u2019t do that; that makes me feel old.\u2019\n\nAnd then you met Kevin.\n\nThey were like any young couple. Very much in love, very touchy feely.\n\nWhat was the original wedding going to be like?\n\nThey came up with a list of 200 to 250 people, and we thought the Bacara would be great. We were designing the most beautiful but not over the top, elegant but shabby chic, gorgeous but fun event\u2026 It was a really fun experience. I have not one negative thing to say until we had to move the whole wedding.\n\nSo what happened?\n\nA publication printed the location and date of the wedding. I got a call from a very unhappy Kevin. [Unhappy at the situation not her.] Even though I told them that we had the best security team and it could still go on without a hitch, they didn\u2019t want 100 million people standing outside trying to take pictures, ruining the intimacy and privacy of that event. So we had to go to Plan B, and we had to do it fast.\n\nYou had a \u201cPlan B\u201d?\n\nWell, we planned it in 10 days or less\u2026 Everything was already in the works, Monique Lhuillier was making all the gowns that were basically ready, all the vendors were in place for the big wedding \u2014 we just didn\u2019t have a location. In that week we decided we can\u2019t do it at a hotel, we can\u2019t do a venue because people were going to know. We limited the guest list to the two families and the wedding party, and then we talked to Britney and Kevin about doing a surprise wedding. Nobody would know.\n\nNot even Britney\u2019s mom?\n\nNo. Nobody knew\u2026 We told everyone and our vendors we were having an engagement party. We tried to use every vendor we could who was going to help at the wedding.\n\nAnd you would throw it at your house in Studio City?\n\nWell, their place wasn\u2019t ready yet\u2026 The vendors made the house look stunning. It was so beautiful. I only wish they could have had more people\u2026 Every person who walked in that night, we handed then an invitation, they opened it up and it said \u201csurprise!\u201d you are here for the wedding and not the engagement party. And we would direct them to the room where they would change into their gowns and tuxedos\u2026\n\nTuxedos? I thought the men were wearing those white Juicy velour jumpsuits\u2026\n\nNo! That\u2019s what they left the house in. They were in tuxedos and gowns. Everybody made such a big deal about that, but that\u2019s what Juicy did for every celebrity who got married. They\u2019d send them the cute little tracksuits. I asked Britney and Kevin what they wanted printed on the back, and Britney said, \u201cMaids! Maids will be cute!\u201d And it was. It was cute! And he said \u201cPimps\u201d which was adorable\u2026 People are closed-minded. It was a joke, it was for fun. It was Juicy tracksuits! 10 years ago people would have given anything for a Juicy tracksuit.\n\nYou must not have gotten a lot of sleep that week.\n\nOh I didn\u2019t sleep that week. And I didn\u2019t sleep the week after, because there were all these stories going on [at the time] that they weren\u2019t really married, and all this B.S. People are going to think what they\u2019re going to think, but I know the truth. They were wonderful people and I\u2019ll say that until the day I die. To this day I don\u2019t talk to a lot of people about it because I still feel protective over them. Unfortunately it didn\u2019t work out \u2014 but what is it, 60% of marriages that don\u2019t?\n\nRead TIME\u2019s 1999 profile of Britney Spears here, in the archives: A Sweet Sensation\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "images": ["http://pixel.carambo.la/Pixel/tmnc11/112753/0/1/0", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/britney-spears-people-cover.jpg?quality=85&w=716&h=628&crop=1", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/time-newsletter-tout-footer.png", "http://pixel.watch/f3fo", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "http://time.com/img/loading-circle.gif", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "http://time.com/img/Paper-plane.svg", "https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/britney-spears-people-cover.jpg", "http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png"], "top_img": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/britney-spears-people-cover.jpg?quality=85&w=716&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Laura Stampler"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/3394238/britney-spears-kevin-federline-wedding/", "title": "Britney Spears and Kevin Federline Wedding Planner 10 Year Anniversary", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Britney Spears and Kevin Federline's Wedding Planner, 10 Year Anniversary", "news_keywords": "Britney Spears, Wedding, Kevin Federline, 10 Years, Juicy, Pimp Tracksuit, Marriage", "description": "Britney and Kevin were married September 18, 2004, in their wedding planner's Studio City home.
