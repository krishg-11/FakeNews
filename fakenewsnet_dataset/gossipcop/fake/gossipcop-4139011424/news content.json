ABC News, which produces the program, declined to make executives available for comment.\n\nLaunch of the show will extend the presence of \u201cGMA\u201d to the network\u2019s daytme schedule from its early-morning grid, and allow ABC to create bigger packages for advertisers, as NBC does with four hours of \u201cToday.\u201d The idea should also boost affiliates, as ABC can promote the extension during the main \u201cGMA\u201d broadcast that airs between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m.\n\nThe new hour is expected to be taped, not presented live, and run at 1 p.m. on weekdays. One scenario that has been discussed for the new hour would involve making use of the live, in-studio audience assembled each morning for the 8 a.m. hour of the flagship show. ABC said earlier this year it would replace \u201cThe Chew\u201d with the new \u201cGMA\u201d hour.\n\n\u201cGood Morning America\u201d enjoyed an afternoon presence in the not-too-distant past. Josh Elliott and Lara Spencer co-anchored a short run of \u201cGood Afternoon America\u201d between July and September of 2012 in a separate bid to test expansion of the franchise.\n\n\u201cGMA\u201d makes its leap as its battle for viewers with main rival\u201cToday\u201d remains intense. \u201cGood Morning America\u201d remains TV\u2019s most-watched morning program, but \u201cToday, co-anchored by Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie, typically wins more viewers between 25 and 54, the demographic most favored by advertisers. Season to date as of July 13, \u201cToday\u201d has lured 151,000 more viewers between 25 and 54 than its primary competitor, while \u201cGMA\u201d has notched 63,000 more viewers than \u201cToday\u201d overall.\n\nThe expansion to afternoons comes as ABC is also working to expand the digital presence for the show. In April, \u201cGMA\u201d launched a morning newsletter and unveiled a revamped \u201cGMA\u201d website that was not tied to ABC News\u2019 content deal with Yahoo. At the time, Michael Corn, \u201cGMA\u2019 senior executive producer, noted that producers often gathered together more information and material than the 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. program could handle. \u201cWe have so much content and a two-hour program isn\u2019t even enough for the amount of stories we have to tell, and the amount of information we have,\u201d he toldVariety.\n\nHaines will leave \u201cThe View\u201d to participate in the new program, marking the second departure of an ABC News correspondent from the program in recent days. ABC News announced earlier this week that Faris would leave her position at the show to do focus on reporting bigger stories. That narrows \u201cThe View\u201d table down to four hosts: Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin and Meghan McCain. Details about the hosts for the third \u201cGMA\u201d hour were reported previously by Page Six.", "images": ["http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-31f3D02tYU8zY.gif",
