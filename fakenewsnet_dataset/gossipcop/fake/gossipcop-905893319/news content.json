As Gossip Cop has repeatedly stressed, the movie star isn\u2019t dating the MIT professor, so this entire story is based on a lie.\n\n\n\nAccording to Woman\u2019s Day, Pitt is inspired by Clooney\u2019s marriage to wife Amal, a human rights lawyer who works completely outside of Hollywood. Oxman is an architecture professor who also has no ties to the movie industry, so Pitt supposedly asked his friend how to keep her interested once his star power wears off.\n\n\n\nAs the story goes, Clooney would rather tease his friend than offer him guidance. A so-called \u201csource\u201d tells the magazine, \u201cGeorge loves that Brad has been thrown off his game and makes fun of him endlessly. It\u2019s sweet payback for all the jokes Brad tossed his way after George started dating Amal.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe outlet\u2019s questionable insider goes on to say that although Clooney has been messing with Pitt, Amal has actually been \u201cadvising Neri on ways to keep calm and grounded amid the media circus.\u201d The seemingly nonexistent tipster further contends that Pitt \u201cis very grateful\u201d for Amal because \u201che\u2019s not used to having a non-famous girlfriend and Neri never expected to be in the limelight.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe tabloid\u2019s article, however, is nothing more than fan fiction. Pitt\u2019s rep has told us on the record several times that the actor isn\u2019t dating Oxman. This has been backed up by trusted publications such as People, which recently noted Pitt and Oxman have a \u201cprofessional friendship,\u201d as while as E! News, which similarly reported that Pitt and Oxman are \u201cstrictly friends.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis article only seems to exist because Woman\u2019s Day came up with a way to drag Clooney into his pal\u2019s imaginary romance. In addition to the fact that Pitt and Oxman aren\u2019t a couple, a mutual pal of ours and Clooney tells us on background that the actor\u2019s friend hasn\u2019t turned to him for advice about dating the MIT professor. This is just a fabricated story based on a phony premise.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, this isn\u2019t the first time Gossip Cop has had to debunk a bogus story about Clooney supposedly playing a role in his friend\u2019s love life. We recently busted New Idea for making up a story about Clooney getting Pitt and Jennifer Aniston back together. This latest article involving Oxman is equally untrue.", "images": ["http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/assets/gfx/ff/logos/femalefirst.png", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/eusa_dance.gif", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/square/250/b/bizarre-female-first.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/square/250/x/xmas2019herbalrecoverypackcmykhr.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/p/perez-hilton-a1527cbba8e4c1e59cffa4a7d85631ad33bea6ca.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/m/madonna-1f98f322675350ce7b763a92ba5417bd65878b79.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/k/kristin-chenoweth-5b5e2ebbaba7047f29f1ecc4ac0a3b2761a1a6da.jpg", "https://a.collective-media.net/seg/etu/1b", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/square/250/b/bizarre-female-first.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/viewtopic.php?t=751738", "title": "Female First Forum", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk", "summary": ""}
