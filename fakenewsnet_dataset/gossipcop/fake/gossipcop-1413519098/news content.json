Even though the reality star and NBA baller have officially returned to Los Angeles with their precious daughter, Tristan feels \u201cdumped\u201d since she\u2019s not letting him move in with them. \u201cShe still wants him in her life, and she wants True to have a father,\u201d a source tells In Touch exclusively. \u201cHe may not be the best boyfriend, but he\u2019s a good father.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019d been planning to ask him to move in when she returned home from Cleveland with True,\u201d our source explained. \u201cBut then the cheating scandal happened, and she had to rethink everything. There obviously are trust issues now. But Khlo\u00e9 still hasn\u2019t kicked him to the curb. She found it in her heart to forgive him. She just doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s the right time for them to be moving in together.\u201d\n\nIt looks like Khlo\u00e9 is trying to put the drama behind her once and for all, as she was spotted out with the Cavaliers star on June 18. The new parents stopped by the celebrity hotspot Nobu before making their way to The Peppermint Club. Khlo\u00e9 appears to be putting on a brave face after welcoming baby True in April, days after the cheating scandal came to light. As they work on their relationship issues, Khlo\u00e9 will stay at her house while Tristan will reside nearby at his Los Angeles-based home.\n\nKhlo\u00e9 has faced no shortage of drama after Tristan\u2019s infidelities. A video surfaced in April of her baby daddy kissing one woman while being groped by another in Washington, D.C., while Khlo\u00e9 was reportedly three months pregnant. Making matters even worse, Tristan was also spotted making out with Instagram model Lani Blair at an NYC nightclub days before Khlo\u00e9 gave birth to their first child together. Time will tell if they can work through their differences!\n\nRead more about Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan in the latest issue of In Touch on newsstands now!", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Felicity-Jones-Pregnant.jpg?crop=0px%2C76px%2C2085px%2C2085px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/90-DF-Jesse-Meester-Reacts-to-Avery-and-Angelas-Tell-All-Feud.jpg?crop=0px%2C39px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/90-Day-Fiance-Star-Nicole-Jimenos-BF-01.jpg?crop=53px%2C39px%2C1906px%2C1080px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Meghan-King-Edmonds-Ready-to-Date-After-Jim-Edmonds-Divorce.jpg?crop=0px%2C78px%2C2770px%2C1572px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/khloe-tristan.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jamie-Otis-Claps-Back-at-Mom-Shaming-Sometimes.jpg?crop=0px%2C294px%2C3857px%2C2183px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/33727838-849152021936277-486169437251043328-n.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Olivia-Jade-and-Isabella-Gianulli-Dreading-Holidays-Amid-Mom-Lori-Loughlin-Legal-Battle-01.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/meghan-markle-prince-harry-kate-middleton-prince-william-reunite.png?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/khloe-kardashian-baby-weight-teaser-image.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/khloe-tristan.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/princess-beatrice-cancels-engagement-party-amid-prince-andrew-scandal.jpg?crop=0px%2C428px%2C3516px%2C1990px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Celebs-With-the-Most-Outrageous-Demands-in-Hollywood-Promo.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/khloe-mag.jpg?w=1180&h=1000&crop=1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/an-unexpected-killer-larry-swartz-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2550px%2C1444px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Biel-Pushed-Justin-Timberlake-Make-a-Public-Statement-PDA-Scandal-Promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/tristan-thompsn-rob-kardashian.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Baby-to-Age-4-See-Baby-Chanel-Nicole-Transformation-Over-the-Years-landing-01.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C2000px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tara-Reid-Transformation-Promo.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jesse-Meester-Tom-Brooks-Bonded-Over-Darcey-Silva-Drama-01.jpg?crop=2px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/khloe-tristan.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Samantha Benitz"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/tristan-thompson-feels-dumped-khloe-kardashian-162092/", "title": "Tristan Thompson Feels Dumped by Khloe Kardashian Since She Won't Let Him Move in", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian has forgiven Tristan Thompson after his shocking cheating scandal, but she's not exactly ready to play house with her baby daddy just yet.
