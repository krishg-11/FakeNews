{"url": "people.com/politics/people-president-trump-blocked-twitter-chrissy-teigen-stephen-king/", "text": "President Donald Trump\u2018s use of Twitter has long been a controversial component of his presidency, in part because of his frequent use of the \u201cblock\u201d button, which the president has unleashed on a number of notable actors, authors and activists who have used Twitter as a platform to criticize him and his administration.\n\nBut his critics scored a victory on Wednesday when a federal judge in Manhattan ruled that blocking his foes from viewing his tweets violates the First Amendment \u2014 because his Twitter feed is an official government account.\n\n\u201cWell well well we meet again @realDonaldTrump,\u201d model and author Chrissy Teigen, whom Trump blocked in July 2017, tweeted Wednesday after the judge\u2019s ruling was announced.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, seven Twitter users and the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University sued the president, claiming Trump\u2019s account is part of the government and blocking them violates their First Amendment rights.\n\nJudge Naomi Reice Buchwald agreed with the plaintiffs, noting in her ruling that \u201cthe speech in which they seek to engage is protected by the First Amendment.\u201d She also wrote that Trump and White House social media director Dan Scavino \u201cexert governmental control over certain aspects of the @realDonaldTrump account.\u201d\n\nwell well well we meet again @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/WajEXiAQVi \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) May 23, 2018\n\nHere\u2019s a running list of notable people who have received the \u201c@arealDonaldTrump blocked you\u201d message on Twitter \u2014 but should be able to read his tweets again soon:\n\n1. Laura Packard\n\nPackard, a small business owner from Las Vegas who is currently battling stage four Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma, was blocked by Trump after tweeting at him about health care and concerns over the repeal of Obamacare. The tweets that seemed to push Trump over the edge are from Sept. 19 of last year, in which she accused him of putting \u201cAmerica last,\u201d and questioned him over the Graham-Cassidy healthcare bill.\n\nDon't you mean put America last? https://t.co/8tTxFjdYIw \u2014 Laura Packard (P.S. Pls ban the nazis already) (@lpackard) September 19, 2017\n\nYour latest TrumpCare bill would mean 32M Americans will lose their health insurance. What about putting them first? https://t.co/wPObZisLQp \u2014 Laura Packard (P.S. Pls ban the nazis already) (@lpackard) September 19, 2017\n\nOmg. The President of the United States just personally blocked me. pic.twitter.com/MgLfwufOXC \u2014 Laura Packard (P.S. Pls ban the nazis already) (@lpackard) September 20, 2017\n\nThe morning of Sept. 20, she woke up and discovered that Trump had blocked her. Now, she has one request for Trump, she told ThinkProgress \u2014 and it isn\u2019t that he\u2019ll lift the block: \u201cI just wish that he would listen.\u201d\n\nBut Packard addressed Wednesday\u2019s ruling, helpfully explaining how Trump can unblock users en masse.\n\nOh hai @realdonaldtrump! If you need to unblock thousands (tens of thousands?) of people in a hurry, perhaps due to court order, you can do it 1 by 1 but it's a lot easier to use https://t.co/HswTF8YZED and then do mass unblocking. \u2014 Laura Packard (@lpackard) May 23, 2018\n\n2. Rosie O\u2019Donnell\n\nTrump and O\u2019Donnell have been feuding for years, but it took until July 23, 2017, for him to finally block her on Twitter. It was a tweet that mentioned the instantly infamous unsubstantiated Russian dossier, which alleged that Russian spies had explicit information about Trump, which finally prompted him to block the former talk show host\n\non ur back ? dear god don \u2013 the russians bought their train ticket \u2013 u r confused -prostitutes peeed on ur back in moscow @realDonaldTrump \u2014 ROSIE (@Rosie) July 23, 2017\n\nJust a few hours after sending the tweet, O\u2019Donnell found herself blocked.\n\nawww @realdonaldtrump \u2013 i get it \u2013 its too tough to read the truth \u2026 poor baby \u2013 i understand don \u2013 u take care of u \u2013 friend #BLOCKED pic.twitter.com/EQxnZarnhE \u2014 ROSIE (@Rosie) July 24, 2017\n\nShe\u2019s still tweeting about him, though \u2014 and has asked others to forward along her messages.\n\n3. Anne Rice\n\nI've been blocked from Trump's twitter site. Hilarious. This after a few responses to his tweets! Wow. I'm amazed! Truly amazed. \u2014 Anne Rice (@AnneRiceAuthor) June 26, 2017\n\nMaybe I'll be personally attacked next. One can always hope. \u2014 Anne Rice (@AnneRiceAuthor) June 26, 2017\n\nAnd I so relished responding personally to Trump's tweets. Ah well\u2026 \u2014 Anne Rice (@AnneRiceAuthor) June 26, 2017\n\nThe president denied the Interview With the Vampire author one of her favorite pastimes \u2014 personally responding to Trump\u2019s many tweets. She frequently tweeted about the president, his policy decisions, and yes, his tweets. In fact, it\u2019s almost all she tweets about even now, after she\u2019s been blocked. It was a now-deleted tweet about the Republican health care plan that finally got her banned from his account on June 26.\n\nImage zoom Jeff Vespa/WireImage; Alex Wong/Getty\n\nThe tweet read:\n\n\u201cThe Trump-GOP health care plan is a tax cut for the rich. Millions will lose coverage. A complete rip off.\u201d\n\nNow, like O\u2019Donnell, Rice hopes that her messages will still find their way to Trump through her followers.\n\nAlready been smeared by the right. Please RT this to Trump. He's blocked me. https://t.co/jvnIKnJDsj \u2014 Anne Rice (@AnneRiceAuthor) August 13, 2017\n\n4. Chrissy Teigen\n\nAfter 9 years of hating Donald J Trump, telling him \"lol no one likes you\" was the straw pic.twitter.com/MhZ6bXT1Dp \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) July 25, 2017\n\nThe latest addition to the \u201cblocked by Trump\u201d club, Teigen is an outspoken critic of the president, and has been, in her own words, for \u201cnine years\u201d \u2014 long before he ever ran for the White House. What was the insult though, that pushed Trump to hit the block button? According to Teigen, it was her most recent attack, on Sunday:\n\nLolllllll no one likes you \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) July 23, 2017\n\nTeigen shared a screenshot of the notification that Trump had blocked her, writing: \u201cAfter 9 years of hating Donald J Trump, telling him \u2018lol no one likes you\u2019 was the straw.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Francois Mori/AP\n\n5. Stephen King\n\nTrump has blocked me from reading his tweets. I may have to kill myself. \u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) June 13, 2017\n\nHe\u2019s an expert on twists and turns, but not even King could have predicted that the president would block him on Twitter. Before the block, in mid-June, King had frequently tweeted criticisms of Trump, but rarely tagged the president\u2019s twitter accounts (@realDonaldTrump or @POTUS). However, there were some pretty tough-worded tweets, so it\u2019s possible they ended up on Trump\u2019s radar.\n\nDonald Trump: A remarkable combination of unhinged and dumb as dirt. Time to start talking impeachment. Really. Enough is enough. \u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) May 10, 2017\n\nTrump's tweets in his first hundred days draw a pretty clear portrait: he's an almost textbook case of narcissistic personality disorder. \u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) May 4, 2017\n\nWith President Forrest Trump, every day is like a rancid box of chocolates. You never know what kind of shit you're going to get next. \u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) April 11, 2017\n\n6. Marina Sirtis\n\nI've been blocked by our Prez !! \u2014 Marina Sirtis (@Marina_Sirtis) May 9, 2017\n\nThe actress and Star Trek: The Next Generation star can pinpoint her blockage to a single tweet. The whole thing happened pretty quickly. First, she tweeted this on May 8:\n\n@realDonaldTrump threatening to go to WAR to deflect from Russiagate!! Willing to let our boys die to save his sorry ass! \u2014 Marina Sirtis (@Marina_Sirtis) May 9, 2017\n\nSix minutes later, she tweeted that she had been blocked. Sometimes, these things happen fast.\n\n7. Bess Kalb\n\nOH. MY. EFFING. GOD.\n\nThe President of the United States just blocked me on Twitter because I hurt his feelings. #MAGA pic.twitter.com/oB5zTAs7In \u2014 Bess Kalb (@bessbell) May 29, 2017\n\nA writer for Jimmy Kimmel Live! and The New Yorker, Kelb found herself blocked by the president after a posting a number of tweets about him, as well as regular responses to many of his tweets. She said she was blocked because she \u201churt his feelings.\u201d There\u2019s no telling which of Kelb\u2019s tweets was the final straw for Trump, but here are a number of guesses:\n\nTrump is the funniest example of why you should always be nice to the makeup lady. \u2014 Bess Kalb (@bessbell) May 28, 2017\n\nThe President of the United States of America just picked a twitter fight with Rosie O'Donnell. https://t.co/yYwVbq74Sh \u2014 Bess Kalb (@bessbell) May 11, 2017\n\nOh boy, honey. I've tried to lay off and let you President like you said you would, but this is a new kind of simplistic nonsense rhetoric. \u2014 Bess Kalb (@bessbell) May 28, 2017\n\n8. Andy Signore\n\nINSANITY!! \u2013 The @POTUS @realdonaldtrump can't take my tweets criticizing his reign, so they BLOCKED me \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I have a theory about this (1of8) pic.twitter.com/KcW7JdFpd8 \u2014 Andy Signore (@andysignore) June 5, 2017\n\nSignore is the mastermind behind the YouTube channel Honest Trailers. What\u2019s surprising is that Signore wasn\u2019t a habitual tweet-at-Trump-er. Instead, he wrote one critical tweet, about Trump misconstruing a quote by London Mayor Sadiq Khan on the terror attack at London Bridge.\n\nI am so damn sick of bully @realDonaldTrump taking words out of context to act out his agenda of fear, corruption & bigotry. #NotMyPresident \u2014 Andy Signore (@andysignore) June 4, 2017\n\nBy the next night, he was blocked.\n\n9. Angelo Carusone\n\nSigh. The last time I @ mentioned him on Twitter was back in February. So what gives? Does he really not have better things to do right now? pic.twitter.com/KBGG3YKfvf \u2014 Angelo Carusone (@GoAngelo) June 15, 2017\n\nTrump\u2019s blocking of Carusone, the president of the progressive watchdog group Media Matters for America, left him at a loss.\n\nCarusone said he hadn\u2019t tweeted at Trump in four months by the time the president blocked him on June 15.\n\n\u201cSigh. The last time I @ mentioned him on Twitter was back in February. So what gives? Does he really not have better things to do right now?\u201d Carusone wrote.\n\n10. Holly Figueroa O\u2019Reilly\n\nWho says Trump doesn't read our tweets? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com/SQ8mb06InR \u2014 Holly O'Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) May 29, 2017\n\nSongwriter O\u2019Reilly, who was also one of the organizers of the #MarchForTruth calling for an independent probe into the Trump administration\u2019s possible ties to the Russian government, found herself blocked by Trump at the end of May. She\u2019s tweeted a number of insults at Trump, including the following:\n\nDid you seriously use your 11-year-old son, Barron Trump, as a political shield? You are the biggest f'ing coward.#TuesdayThoughts pic.twitter.com/wswdoBTsM7 \u2014 Holly O'Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) July 25, 2017\n\nO\u2019Reilly, however, isn\u2019t taking Trump\u2019s blockage lightly. She, along with six other blocked-by-Trump Twitter users, as well as the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, have sued Trump, saying that the blocking is \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and seeking to remove it, according to court documents.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/chrissy-teigen7.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/chrissy-teigen7.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/stephen-king-wp.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/90dd53e0cc9f6299580495ce61775a1f?s=300&d=blank&r=g"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/chrissy-teigen7.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Diana Pearl"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/politics/people-president-trump-blocked-twitter-chrissy-teigen-stephen-king/", "title": "Good News, Chrissy Teigen: Judge Rules Trump Violates First Amendment by Blocking Twitter Followers", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "donald trump, donald trump blocks on twitter, donald trump twitter, who does donald trump block on twitter, chrissy teigen donald trump, donald trump twitter block", "news_keywords": "donald trump, donald trump blocks on twitter, donald trump twitter, who does donald trump block on twitter, chrissy teigen donald trump, donald trump twitter block", "description": "President Trump's critics scored a victory on Wednesday when a federal judge in Manhattan ruled that blocking his foes from viewing his tweets violates the First Amendment", "og": {"title": "Good News, Chrissy Teigen: Judge Rules Trump Violates First Amendment by Blocking Twitter Followers", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/politics/people-president-trump-blocked-twitter-chrissy-teigen-stephen-king/", "description": "President Trump's critics scored a victory on Wednesday when a federal judge in Manhattan ruled that blocking his foes from viewing his tweets violates the First Amendment", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/chrissy-teigen7.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/politics/people-president-trump-blocked-twitter-chrissy-teigen-stephen-king/", "description": "President Trump's critics scored a victory on Wednesday when a federal judge in Manhattan ruled that blocking his foes from viewing his tweets violates the First Amendment", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/chrissy-teigen7.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/politics/people-president-trump-blocked-twitter-chrissy-teigen-stephen-king/", "title": "Good News, Chrissy Teigen: Judge Rules Trump Violates First Amendment by Blocking Twitter Followers", "description": "President Trump's critics scored a victory on Wednesday when a federal judge in Manhattan ruled that blocking his foes from viewing his tweets violates the First Amendment", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/chrissy-teigen7.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://people.com", "summary": ""}
