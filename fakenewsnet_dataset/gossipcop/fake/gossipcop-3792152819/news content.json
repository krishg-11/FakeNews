And this year, Hollywood upped their game \u2014 with shocking haircuts, major announcements and one scary on-set prank.\n\nStar Trek star George Takei kicked things off, announcing in the early minutes of Saturday that he was planning a run for Congress in 2018 \u2014 targeting California\u2019s 22nd District so he can take on Republican Devin Nunes.\n\nTakei told The Daily Buzz that he wanted to take a bigger stand in politics. \u201cWith what is going on now in the country, I couldn\u2019t stand by any longer merely as a citizen,\u201d Takei said. \u201cI knew I had to take a bigger stand. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m running for Congress. My hope is to challenge Devin Nunes for his seat in 2018.\u201d\n\nWell, the cat's out of the bag it seems. Let's do this! #Takei2018 https://t.co/Wf7qvV1eXj \u2014 George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) April 1, 2017\n\nNo, I'm not running for Congress. Happy 4/1! But Jon Ossoff is on 4/18.

Happy 4/1!,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut Jon Ossoff is on 4/18. Help him win at electjon.com.

Happy April Fools Pitches! I got you!!!\u201d\n\nFor all the Bravoholics out there, Real Housewives of New York City star Bethenny Frankel had a surprise on Saturday \u2014 posting a shot of herself on Instagram with a new pixie haircut.\n\nShe captioned the shot, \u201c#shorthairdontcare\u201d and \u201c#newseasonnewlook\u201d (among others).\n\nOf course, anyone following Frankel on Snapchat would know the 46-year-old Skinnygirl mogul was just joking around \u2014 as her she\u2019s been showing off her bob on the social media site while skiing with her 6-year-old daughter, Bryn.\n\nGigi Hadid also pulled a hairdo prank, sharing a shot of herself with what appeared to be short hair and scissor emojis. However she later updated the caption to share that it was just a prank.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59d6486f5205aabdbf65fd1a39fa97ee?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/michael-phelps.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/michael-phelps.jpg"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/michael-phelps.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Quinn"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/celebrity/celebrity-aprils-fool-day-jokes-2017/", "title": "Michael Phelps Returning to Swimming?
