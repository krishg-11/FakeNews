Scott even admitted he\u2019s been carrying the ring around with him for weeks and has kept all planning offline so Phan couldn\u2019t possibly come across any details accidentally.\n\nThe HGTV star, who has released two country singles with brother Jonathan, recently snuck off to New York City to record his own version of the Train song \u201cMarry Me.\u201d During tonight\u2019s dinner, he arranged for the restaurant to play the track while he and Phan were having dinner, which cued the staff to bring out a cake decorated with illustrations from one of Phan\u2019s favorite books, Dr. Seuss\u2019s Oh the Places You\u2019ll Go, tweaked to read \u201cOh the Places We\u2019ll Go,\u201d as a nod to their continuing journey together.\n\nThe festivities continued after dinner with a surprise engagement party at a nearby venue that Phan had been led to believe was a company holiday party. Friends and family, including both fianc\u00e9s\u2019 parents, as well as Scott siblings Jonathan and J.D., were all in attendance.\n\nRELATED: The Property Brothers Have the Most Amazing Holiday Vacation Planned for Their Girlfriends\n\nWATCH THIS: Ever Wonder Where the Property Brothers Live?\n\nRELATED: The Property Brothers Are \u2018Good to Do Some Babysitting\u2019 for Chip and Joanna Gaines\n\nScott and Phan met in 2010 at a Toronto Fashion Week event, and have been dating for six years.
