Here\u2019s what went down: Tran\u2019s lawyers notified the court seven days in advance that she would be unable to attend the hearing in person due to work obligations, and instead planned to participate via phone. Gossip Cop has learned that at the hearing, Brown\u2019s camp tried arguing for a dismissal, on the grounds that Tran should have given 12 days\u2019 notice, not seven.\n\nAs Gossip Cop reported, Tran obtained a temporary restraining order against Brown in late February, accusing him of harassing her, assaulting her, and threatening to kill her. The model-actress\u2019 best friend LaCour was also awarded a temporary restraining order after making similar allegations. Both are now seeking to get permanent stay-away orders against the singer.\n\nInitially, the judge the was inclined to agree. But Brown\u2019s legal team apparently failed to recognize this was a joint hearing with LaCour, who was in the court room ready to testify. \u201cWhat they didn\u2019t take into consideration was the other case,\u201d one person who was at the hearing tells Gossip Cop exclusively. We\u2019re told Brown\u2019s attorneys \u201ccame swooping into court\u201d expecting to get off easy on the technicality with Trans\u2019 absence, but the judge pointed out that Brown \u201cdidn\u2019t show up either,\u201d despite another petitioner \u201cready to go.\u201d\n\nGossip Cop hears Brown\u2019s attorney tried to argue he had not been served in the cases, but evidence was presented to show he was properly served the restraining orders for both Tran and LaCour. Upon seeing that, \u201chis lawyers began to struggle because they had no clue\u201d about the second case, we\u2019re told, and were not prepared to argue it. Furthermore, the judge accused his side of making a \u201cmockery\u201d of the court. He granted their request for a continuance but demanded Brown appear at the next hearing, which is slated for June 15.\n\nAnd in an indication of how seriously the judge is taking these matters, the next hearing will be an evidentiary one, in which both sides must present evidence regarding the allegations. It\u2019s also worth noting that Brown\u2019s lead attorney, Mark Geragos, wasn\u2019t even the one who represented him on Tuesday. Rather, a female lawyer was sent in his place. Last month, Tran\u2019s manager slammed Geragos for accusing her of making up the domestic violence allegations for self-promotion.
