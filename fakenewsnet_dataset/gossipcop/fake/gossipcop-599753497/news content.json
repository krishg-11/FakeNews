I gotta do better and I will.

[Shaking my damn head].\u201d\n\nRumors swirled after photos surfaced online showing him in a car with a woman after a Miami Beach nightclub appearance.\n\nThe shots quickly caught the attention of the Twittersphere, and Hart\u2019s name trended on the social media site.\n\nImage zoom Eniko Parrish and Kevin Hart (left), Torrei Hart (right) Allen Berezovsky/Getty; Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic\n\nHart\u2019s Ex-Wife Claimed That He Cheated on Her with Parrish While They Were Married\n\nHart was again forced to address rumors of infidelity a month later, in August, when his ex-wife, Torrei, claimed that Hart and Parrish started dating before he split from Torrei.\n\nParrish caused a stir on social media when she wrote on Instagram that she and Hart had been together for the past eight years. Fans and followers were quick to point out that Hart and Torrei got divorced six years ago.\n\n\u201cNumbers don\u2019t lie. Dates don\u2019t lie at the end of the day,\u201d Torrei told TMZ after she and Parrish went back and forth in a series of now-deleted Instagram comments.\n\nKevin Hart\u2019s Ex-Wife Torrei Says He Was Cheating on Her with Current Wife Eniko Parrish\n\n\u201cShe forced my hand to address this publicly.

They were separated living in separate homes. I was never a secret.\u201d\n\nHart appeared to address Torrei\u2019s claims in a video on his Instagram Story, saying, \u201cGoing to be honest with you people, I\u2019m at a point where I can\u2019t even be shocked anymore. All I do is laugh man.\u201d\n\nHart and Parrish, 32, married last August in a lavish California ceremony after a two-year engagement.
