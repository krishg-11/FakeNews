She added: \u201cAnd I did, it\u2019s okay. But what scared me was in that moment \u2014 how would another woman who doesn\u2019t feel comfortable taking off her headscarf feel?\u201d\n\nLohan, who has been photographed carrying a Koran and says she finds \u201csolace\u201d studying the Muslim holy book, said she didn\u2019t know why she was asked to take her headscarf off but found the experience \u201creally jarring.\u201d She told hosts Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid: \u201cI\u2019m from New York \u2014 I\u2019m born and raised there, but I was a little intimidated.\u201d\n\nWhen Reid asked the Parent Trap star why she was wearing the headscarf, she said it was \u201cout of respect\u201d for the Turkish women she had met with on her trip. \u201cI was\u2026 leaving Turkey and\u2026 when I see certain people I feel more comfortable acting the same way as the other women \u2014 that\u2019s just a personal respect issue for me that I have,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen Morgan asked Lohan about her views on President Donald Trump, Lohan said she thought he should be given a fair chance. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with his policies and the things he is doing,\u201d she said. \u201cBut at the end of the day he is the president right now. So what\u2019s the point of picking on someone instead of seeing what they\u2019re capable \u2014 or not capable \u2014 of.\u201d However, she added that she did think his Twitter account should be taken away \u201cor deleted.\u201d Watch the clip below:\n\nWrite to Kate Samuelson at kate.samuelson@time.com.", "images": ["https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/time-newsletter-tout-footer.png", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/juice-wrld-security-guards-gun-charges.jpg?quality=85&w=555", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/lindsay-lohan.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Beyonce-on-pregnancy-rumors.jpg?quality=85&w=573", "http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png"], "top_img": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/lindsay-lohan.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kate Samuelson"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/4676698/lindsay-lohan-airport-headscarf/", "title": "Lindsay Lohan: I Was 'Racially Profiled' at the Airport for Wearing a Headscarf", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Lindsay Lohan, Lindsay Lohan good morning britain, Lindsay Lohan piers morgan, Lindsay Lohan headscarf, Lindsay Lohan islam, Lindsay Lohan converting, Lindsay Lohan accent", "news_keywords": "Lindsay Lohan, Lindsay Lohan good morning britain, Lindsay Lohan piers morgan, Lindsay Lohan headscarf, Lindsay Lohan islam, Lindsay Lohan converting, Lindsay Lohan accent", "description": "Lindsay Lohan has said she was stopped at London's Heathrow Airport after flying in from Turkey because she was wearing a headscarf.", "og": {"title": "Lindsay Lohan: I Was 'Racially Profiled' at the Airport for Wearing a Headscarf", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/4676698/lindsay-lohan-airport-headscarf/", "description": "\"I'm from New York \u2014 I'm born and raised there, but I was a little intimidated\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/lindsay-lohan.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/4676698/lindsay-lohan-airport-headscarf/", "description": "Lindsay Lohan has said she was stopped at London's Heathrow Airport after flying in from Turkey because she was wearing a headscarf.", "media": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/lindsay-lohan.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/4676698/lindsay-lohan-airport-headscarf/", "title": "Lindsay Lohan: I Was 'Racially Profiled' at the Airport for Wearing a Headscarf", "description": "\"I'm from New York \u2014 I'm born and raised there, but I was a little intimidated\"", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/lindsay-lohan.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=512&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Dzf_XE3zH8"], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
