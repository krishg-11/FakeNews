The model, 29, opened up about the experience and what she worried about most about her ex\u2019s wedding to Meghan Markle in a column for U.K. magazine The Spectator.\n\n\u201cFriends are starting to get married, which means the dilemma of British wedding attire. Hats,\u201d Bonas admitted. \u201cWhy do I find hats so tricky? Tricky to wear, tricky to look at, and extremely tricky for the poor soul sitting in the pew behind.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost of the time I avoid headgear,\u201d she revealed. \u201cThis can prompt disapproving looks from the older generations. Last weekend I attended the royal wedding. The invitation clearly stated that guests must wear hats. Yikes.\u201d\n\nCan\u2019t get enough of PEOPLE\u2019s Royals coverage?
