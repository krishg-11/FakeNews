Specifically, Theroux has turned to pal Emma Stone quite a bit recently. Cameras have spotted the two grabbing a bite to eat in New York and vacationing together late last month in France.\n\nNow, according to Life & Style, the 46-year-old actor is planning to move in with Stone \u2013 who lives in Bel Air, not far from Aniston \u2013 even though New York is his home.\n\n\u201cJen\u2019s worst nightmare is about to come true,\u201d says an insider. \u201cHe\u2019s told friends he\u2019s moving to LA for a while, and it looks like he\u2019ll be staying at Emma\u2019s house. It\u2019s the ultimate girl-code betrayal. Poor Jen just can\u2019t seem to catch a break.\u201d\n\nThe source goes on to reveal that things are heating up between Theroux and Stone, and they could \u201cbecome Hollywood\u2019s next power couple.\u201d And for Aniston, this could end up being similar to an experience she after her last divorce \u2013 avoiding her ex and his new woman on the red carpet and at Hollywood events, like she did with her first husband Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.\n\nMANIAC 2018? #thatsawrap #bts A post shared by @ justintheroux on Dec 11, 2017 at 10:45am PST\n\nMeanwhile, People Magazine is reporting that Aniston is moving on with her life and not dwelling on the past. Their source says that the former Friends star is happy being single and hanging out with friends like Jason Bateman and Ellen DeGeneres.\n\nRight after her split from Theroux, Aniston laid low for a couple of months. But lately, she has been stepping out more in public, and cameras recently caught her having dinner with Courtney Cox at the National Resources Defense Council benefit.\n\nAniston has also been working, and recently went to Montreal, Canada to film her new Netflix movie with Adam Sandler. Aniston and Sandler were co-stars of the 2011 romantic comedy Just Go With It, and in their latest project they play a couple suspected of murder after the death of a billionaire.\n\nJustin Theroux, our cover guy for the July/August issue, has it all figured out. We talked to him about his bikes, his tats, and how he's managed to look like he hasn't aged in 46 years.

Will Ferrell, Adam McKay and Stephanie Allyne will produce the show along with Aniston.\n\nThis will be Aniston\u2019s first television project since Friends ended in 2004. After that iconic show ended she shifted her focus to film and starred in projects like He\u2019s Just Not That Into You and Horrible Bosses.\n\nIn addition to her acting career, Aniston has started some business ventures, like her own perfume line that she launched in 2010. She also is involved in multiple philanthropic efforts, including supporting AmeriCares and donating to last year\u2019s hurricane victims.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJennifer Aniston has yet to publicly comment on the rumors surrounding Justin Theroux\u2019s very active dating life.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/avatar_user_36_1498683898-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Tiny-Harris-T.I.-Marriage-Drama-Interview-Toya-Wright-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Jennifer-Aniston-Is-Reportedly-Heartbroken-Over-Justin-Therouxs-Plans-To-Move-In-With-Emma-Stone.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/anne-hathaway-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/lindsay-lohan-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jocelyn-Savage-R.-Kellys-Secrets-YouTube-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Chris-Cornells-Widow-Sues-Soundgarden-With-Claims-They-Are-Stealing-From-Her-And-Her-Kids-300x210.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jennifer-Aniston-Says-Her-Family-Told-Her-She-Would-Never-Make-A-Dime-From-Acting-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Denise-Richards-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Ammika-Harris-Chris-Brown-New-Baby-300x244.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Dove-Cameron-Cameron-Boyce-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/09595d8ad5ddba190876bba26ea20dbd?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emma-Stone-engaged-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kandi-Burruss-Todd-Tucker-Kaela-Baby-Sister-300x244.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Jennifer-Aniston-Is-Reportedly-Heartbroken-Over-Justin-Therouxs-Plans-To-Move-In-With-Emma-Stone.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Suzy Kerr"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/jennifer-aniston-is-reportedly-heartbroken-over-justin-therouxs-plans-to-move-in-with-emma-stone-162385/", "title": "Jennifer Aniston Is Reportedly Heartbroken Over Justin Theroux\u2019s Plans To Move In With Emma Stone", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Suzy Kerr", "news_keywords": "emma stone, jennifer aniston, justin theroux,", "keywords": "celebrity news, emma stone, jennifer aniston, justin theroux,", "description": "Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux announced back in February that they were divorcing after two-and-a-half years of marriage, and since the split,", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Jennifer Aniston Is Reportedly Heartbroken Over Justin Theroux\u2019s Plans To Move In With Emma Stone", "description": "Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux announced back in February that they were divorcing after two-and-a-half years of marriage, and since the split,", "url": "https://celebrityinsider.org/jennifer-aniston-is-reportedly-heartbroken-over-justin-therouxs-plans-to-move-in-with-emma-stone-162385/", "image": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Jennifer-Aniston-Is-Reportedly-Heartbroken-Over-Justin-Therouxs-Plans-To-Move-In-With-Emma-Stone.jpg", "site_name": "Breaking Celebrity News, Entertainment News, and Celebrity Gossip - Celebrity Insider"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-26", "modified_time": "2018-06-26", "author": "https://celebrityinsider.org/author/suzykerr/", "section": "Hollywood", "tag": "justin theroux"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1646073299040160}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@CelebInsiderorg", "site": "@CelebInsiderorg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cropped-favincon-270x270.png", "theme-color": "#dedede"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529985600.0, "source": "http://celebrityinsider.org", "summary": ""}
