Bush over the Iraq war during a concert in 2003. But in recent years, particularly with the growth of Twitter, it\u2019s become extremely commonplace for artists to weigh in on current events. In fact, in addition to singers like Lady Gaga and Katy Perry actively campaigning for Hillary Clinton, many celebrities use Twitter to rip Donald Trump on a daily basis.\n\n{\"position1\": {\"artist\": {\"bio\": \"\", \"id\": 89403, \"name\": \"Miranda Lambert\"}, \"catalog_type\": \"artist\", \"description\": \"\", \"id\": 89403, \"name\": \"Miranda Lambert\", \"related\": [{\"bio\": \"\", \"id\": 89416, \"name\": \"Carrie Underwood\"}, {\"bio\": \"\", \"id\": 115096, \"name\": \"The Band Perry\"}, {\"bio\": \"\", \"id\": 616232, \"name\": \"Pistol Annies\"}, {\"bio\": \"\", \"id\": 58018, \"name\": \"Blake Shelton\"}, {\"bio\": \"\", \"id\": 369639, \"name\": \"Jason Aldean\"}, {\"bio\": \"\", \"id\": 34173, \"name\": \"Eric Church\"}, {\"bio\": \"\", \"id\": 34021, \"name\": \"Little Big Town\"}], \"tagged\": false, \"type\": \"catalog\"}}\n\nBut Lambert has no interest in following suit. In the new article, released on Thursday, the author writes , \u201cWhen I ask Lambert if she thinks that at this moment in history \u2014 with, among other things, this particular president in office \u2014 there is an opening for her to make the kind of issue-oriented songs [Loretta] Lynn became known for, Lambert is quick to dismiss the idea.\u201d\n\nShe is quoted as saying in response, \u201cI am a 100 percent believer in not ever using the platform that I\u2019ve built for anything other than music, because music to me is an escape from your own reality. I don\u2019t want to go to a show and hear somebody preach about their opinions.\u201d And when pushed, Lambert stood her ground.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so divided [in politics], you can\u2019t win anyway. And what are you winning?\u201d she asked. \u201cFor someone to agree with you, and now you\u2019ve spoken your piece and pissed off many other people, just for one person to go, \u2018She\u2019s right\u2019? It doesn\u2019t do any good.\u201d Lambert added, \u201cI\u2019m a country singer. We talk about tears in our beers.\u201d\n\nLambert\u2019s stance is in-line with that of another female country icon. As Gossip Cop reported in February, Reba McEntire argued on \u201cThe View\u201d that entertainers shouldn\u2019t talk politics. Elsewhere in the Billboard story, Lambert also discusses her decision not to do press for her last album, The Weight Of These Wings, to avoid discussing her divorce from Blake Shelton. \u201cI just didn\u2019t need to talk about the record,\u201d she told the magazine.\n\nLambert continues, \u201cIf you want to hear my side of the story or my opinion of what happened, it\u2019s all on there. There\u2019s no mystery anymore \u2014 take from it what you will.\u201d She also revealed she co-wrote \u201cVice\u201d the very day the split went public in 2015. \u201cI walked in with guns blazing,\u201d she shared. \u201cI just knew one thing: I didn\u2019t want a breakup record.\u201d", "images": ["https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/58e1a03b0a15c0af14e571b5?ops=max(650,0),quality(80)", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=270798540384083&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/58e1a03b0a15c0af14e571b5", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6036262&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/246754e0a03b7234b410272fccbc1fa5?ops=gravity(%22center%22),maxcontain(96,60)", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/3d87b979-b07b-4349-894d-492d922dea2c", "http://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/57d1caf936ce620b3fa9e66f", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/246754e0a03b7234b410272fccbc1fa5?ops=gravity(%22center%22),maxcontain(158,100),quality(90)"], "top_img": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/58e1a03b0a15c0af14e571b5", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Shari Weiss"], "canonical_link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-07-28-miranda-lambert-refuses-to-talk-politics-you-cant-win-anyway/", "title": "Miranda Lambert Refuses To Talk Politics: 'You Can't Win Anyway'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Elsewhere in the 'Billboard' story, Lambert discusses her decision not to do press for her last album", "thumbnail": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/58e1a03b0a15c0af14e571b5", "keywords": "Miranda Lambert (89403)", "og": {"title": "Miranda Lambert Refuses To Talk Politics: 'You Can't Win Anyway' | 103.7 The Q", "type": "article", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/58e1a03b0a15c0af14e571b5", "url": "https://1037theq.iheart.com/content/2017-07-28-miranda-lambert-refuses-to-talk-politics-you-cant-win-anyway/", "description": "Elsewhere in the 'Billboard' story, Lambert discusses her decision not to do press for her last album", "site_name": "103.7 The Q", "locale": "en_US"}, "fb": {"app_id": 195502630484729}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://1037theq.iheart.com/content/2017-07-28-miranda-lambert-refuses-to-talk-politics-you-cant-win-anyway/", "site": "@1037theq", "creator": "@1037theq", "description": "Elsewhere in the 'Billboard' story, Lambert discusses her decision not to do press for her last album", "title": "Miranda Lambert Refuses To Talk Politics: 'You Can't Win Anyway' | 103.7 The Q", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/58e1a03b0a15c0af14e571b5", "domain": "1037theq.iheart.com"}, "parsely-title": "Miranda Lambert Refuses To Talk Politics: 'You Can't Win Anyway' | 103.7 The Q", "parsely-link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-07-28-miranda-lambert-refuses-to-talk-politics-you-cant-win-anyway/", "parsely-image-url": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/58e1a03b0a15c0af14e571b5", "parsely-tags": "Miranda Lambert (89403)", "parsely-type": "post", "application-name": "103.7 The Q", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/58e1a03b0a15c0af14e571b5", "google-site-verification": "p2FWrUKxtwBmQgHV4CjD80oKdZZBjmMNByoWvZMsYso", "msvalidate.01": "E98E323249F89ACF6294F958692E230B", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-07-28 09:10:00-05:00", "parsely-author": "Shari Weiss", "parsely-section": "entertainment-news-country"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501214400.0, "source": "http://1037theq.iheart.com", "summary": ""}
