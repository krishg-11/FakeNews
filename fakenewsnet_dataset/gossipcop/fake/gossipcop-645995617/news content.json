Despite all the help they are receiving, Jay is still pitching it so that Beyonce has total support.\n\n\"Neither Beyonce, nor Jay, have been able to enjoy an entire night of sleep since the twins arrived. They are totally exhausted but at the same time have never been happier as a family.\"", "images": ["https://collector.effectivemeasure.net/noscript", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=794201197427829&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://www.iol.co.za/assets/images/social-icons/facebook-rnd-ico.svg", "http://www.iol.co.za/assets/images/social-icons/twitter-rnd-ico.svg", "http://www.iol.co.za/assets/images/social-icons/email-rnd-ico.svg", "http://www.iol.co.za/assets/images/social-icons/whatsapp-rnd-ico.svg", "https://image.iol.co.za/image/1/process/620x349?source=http://ana-baobab-prod-eu-west-2.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ana/media/media/2017/06/30/media-reference%3A03d09e72589c47349b436a01510a4274.jpg", "http://www.iol.co.za/assets/images/header/iol.png", "http://www.iol.co.za/assets/images/social-icons/linkedin-rnd-ico.svg", "https://inm-baobab-prod-eu-west-1.s3.amazonaws.com/public/inm/media/image/2017/07/03/4912114200holdingpowerdinner.jpg"], "top_img": "https://image.iol.co.za/image/1/process/620x349?source=http://ana-baobab-prod-eu-west-2.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ana/media/media/2017/06/30/media-reference%3A03d09e72589c47349b436a01510a4274.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.iol.co.za/entertainment/celebrity-news/jay-z-views-kanye-west-as-a-pesky-fly-10109891", "title": "Jay-Z views Kanye West as a 'pesky fly'", "meta_data": {"fb": {"app_id": 293175074032541}, "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Jay-Z views Kanye West as a 'pesky fly' | IOL Entertainment", "description": "Rap legend Jay-Z is focused on his family's welfare - not the controversy surrounding Kanye West's decision to quit Tidal.", "url": "https://www.iol.co.za/entertainment/celebrity-news/jay-z-views-kanye-west-as-a-pesky-fly-10109891", "image": {"identifier": "https://image.iol.co.za/image/1/process/620x349?source=http://ana-baobab-prod-eu-west-2.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ana/media/media/2017/06/30/media-reference%3A03d09e72589c47349b436a01510a4274.jpg", "width": 3063, "height": 2196}}, "keywords": "entertainment, celebrity news", "description": "Rap legend Jay-Z is focused on his family's welfare - not the controversy surrounding Kanye West's decision to quit Tidal.", "msvalidate.01": "5A0910AA1A12E32A5352933CF5FD96E9", "twitter": {"site": "@IOL", "creator": "@IOL", "description": "Rap legend Jay-Z is focused on his family's welfare - not the controversy surrounding Kanye West's decision to quit Tidal.", "title": "Jay-Z views Kanye West as a 'pesky fly' | IOL Entertainment", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"src": "https://image.iol.co.za/image/1/process/620x349?source=http://ana-baobab-prod-eu-west-2.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ana/media/media/2017/06/30/media-reference%3A03d09e72589c47349b436a01510a4274.jpg"}}, "google-site-verification": "iQCzO2whcLNU6_F3xi1Dck7JMALz7869mBLTQf08wJo", "news_keywords": "entertainment, celebrity news", "msapplication-config": "/assets/images/favicon/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "section": "entertainment/celebrity-news"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.iol.co.za", "summary": ""}
