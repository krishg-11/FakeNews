This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.\u201d\n\nBefore the announcement, Aniston, 48, and Theroux, 46, seemed to thrive despite their frequent time on separate coasts.
