Craig Blankenhorn/Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nParker first revealed in September that SATC3 had been scrapped despite 8 years of encouragement from fans and having a \u201cbeautiful, funny, heartbreaking, joyful, very relatable script and story\u201d ready for filming.\n\nThough sources told PEOPLE Cattrall made \u201coutrageous demands\u201d to re-board the big screen franchise, she later denied that her requests had anything to do with the scrapping of the film and claimed she had never agreed to board SATC3 in the first place \u2014 even refuting an offer to do it back in 2016.\n\n\u201cI never asked for any money, I never asked for any projects. To be thought of as some kind of diva is absolutely ridiculous,\u201d the 61-year-old actress told Piers Morgan in October, saying Parker \u2014 who would have been a producer on the film \u2014 \u201ccould have been nicer.\u201d\n\nCattrall then admitted that she had never been close with the other three co-stars. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been friends,\u201d Cattrall said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been colleagues and in some way, it\u2019s a very healthy place to be.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Kim Cattrall and Sarah Jessica Parker Bryan Bedder/Getty\n\nAs the story unfolded, Parker said she wanted to speak out about it in the press but was held back by coaches who told her to remain quiet.\n\n\u201cWhen all that stuff was happening with Sex and the City, which I know is meaningless in the world, but when it\u2019s happening and you\u2019re caught up in any of the muscle of that stuff, it\u2019s so painful because all you want to do is respond. All you want to do is say, \u2018Are you kidding me!? This is everything I know. This is everything that happened over the last six months. These are the conversations. These are the emails. These are the conversations with lawyers and agents and studio heads,'\u201d she recalled to The Daily Beast. \u201cBut you\u2019re counseled time and time again, \u201cDon\u2019t do it. You\u2019re going to get in the weeds. It\u2019s a nowhere road.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just kept saying, \u2018This was an experience I loved. I love those women. We shared this experience. It was a privilege. If that\u2019s what we\u2019re left with, those memories, there are only four of us who\u2026\u2019 You know?\u201d she added.\n\nImage zoom Sarah Jessica Parker Neilson Barnard/NBCUniversal/NBCU Photo Bank/Getty\n\nShe\u2019s been more vocal recently though, talking about the possibility of trying the project again on the Golden Globes red carpet and even jokingly offering Cattrall\u2019s role to Stephen Colbert.\n\nSo what changed? Turns out the bevy of sexual misconduct allegations plaguing Hollywood allowed Parker to put the SATC3 allegations into perspective.\n\n\u201cThe world shifted,\u201d she said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh this is ridiculous.\u2019 I was afraid to talk about these allegations, and now there are real allegations in the world. And all of a sudden I was like, \u2018I think I\u2019m going to answer the question about the Sex and the City movie.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor so long I was told to be quiet about all of that stuff. And all of a sudden I\u2019m like, \u2018If people are being encouraged to come forward and talk about really difficult, painful, potentially criminal things that they were part of or witnessed, I think I can talk about the Sex and the City 3 movie,'\u201d she added, laughing. \u201cI think it\u2019s okay! I\u2019m a grown freaking woman.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Kim Cattrall, Cynthia Nixon, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kristin Davis Hector Vallenilla/Retna Ltd./Corbis\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kim Cattrall Slams Sarah Jessica Parker as Tensions Surrounding SATC 3 Revealed: \u2018Kim Killed the Movie,\u2019 Says Source\n\nThough she\u2019s open to discussing it now, Parker did understand that the conversation changes the way fans think about the legacy of the project.\n\n\u201cIt hurts the franchise\u2026 it does,\u201d she said. \u201cIt changes the way people experience the show. It changes my own experience to have to talk about it like that. It opens the conversation up time and again. You put the white-hot spotlight back on it again. But then you realize it\u2019s just silliness. Of course I can answer honestly about my experience. Of course I can say what happened. It\u2019s so silly.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/sjp.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/sex-city-wp.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59d6486f5205aabdbf65fd1a39fa97ee?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/sex-and-the-city-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/sarah-jessica-parker-kim-cattrall.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/sjp-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1600px%2C840px&resize=1200%2C630"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/sjp-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1600px%2C840px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Quinn"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/sarah-jessica-parker-sax-and-the-city-3-fallout-enormously-painful/", "title": "Sarah Jessica Parker Says Sex and the City 3 Fallout Was 'Enormously Painful for Me'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Sarah Jessica Parker, Sarah Jessica Parker Sex and the City, Cynthia Nixon, Kristin Davis, Kim Cattrall, Sarah Jessica Parker Kim Cattrall, Sarah Jessica Parker TV,", "news_keywords": "Sarah Jessica Parker, Sarah Jessica Parker Sex and the City, Cynthia Nixon, Kristin Davis, Kim Cattrall, Sarah Jessica Parker Kim Cattrall, Sarah Jessica Parker TV,", "description": "The cancellation of the third\u00a0Sex and the City\u00a0film came with headline-making fallout \u2014 something Sarah Jessica Parker struggled with", "og": {"title": "Sarah Jessica Parker Says Sex and the City 3 Fallout Was 'Enormously Painful for Me'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/movies/sarah-jessica-parker-sax-and-the-city-3-fallout-enormously-painful/", "description": "The cancellation of the third\u00a0Sex and the City\u00a0film came with headline-making fallout \u2014 something Sarah Jessica Parker struggled with", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/sjp-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1600px%2C840px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/movies/sarah-jessica-parker-sax-and-the-city-3-fallout-enormously-painful/", "description": "The cancellation of the third\u00a0Sex and the City\u00a0film came with headline-making fallout \u2014 something Sarah Jessica Parker struggled with", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/sjp-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1600px%2C840px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/movies/sarah-jessica-parker-sax-and-the-city-3-fallout-enormously-painful/", "title": "Sarah Jessica Parker Says Sex and the City 3 Fallout Was 'Enormously Painful for Me'", "description": "The cancellation of the third\u00a0Sex and the City\u00a0film came with headline-making fallout \u2014 something Sarah Jessica Parker struggled with", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/sjp-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1600px%2C840px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://people.com", "summary": ""}
