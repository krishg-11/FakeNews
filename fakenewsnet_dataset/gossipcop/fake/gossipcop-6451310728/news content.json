Things aren\u2019t truthful. I feel like it\u2019s taken [Caitlyn] a really long time to be honest with herself, so I don\u2019t expect her to be honest about my mom now. It\u2019s so hurtful.\u201d As a result, she\u2019s not talking to Jenner right now.\n\nKim Kardashian taped the \u201cEllen DeGeneres Show\u201d on Wednesday, and Gossip Cop has exclusive details from her first talk show interview since being robbed in Paris. We\u2019re told she talked about that harrowing experience, how she no longer speaks to Caitlyn Jenner, and what she\u2019s doing for Kanye West\u2019s upcoming 40th birthday. Check out the videos below!\n\nThe audience member also leaks that Kardashian spoke to DeGeneres at length about the Paris robbery, saying that it \u201cchanged\u201d her life. \u201cI know this sounds crazy, but I know that was meant to happen to me. I feel like it was so meant to happen. I\u2019m such a different person,\u201d she shared. Kardashian continued, \u201cMy whole life as changed as far as how I travel and security. I never thought that I needed security staying outside my door, even though I had a lot of jewelry. If you think about it, yeah, I should have had a security guard outside my door 24/7 when I\u2019m traveling and I didn\u2019t. Now, I have several, just for me to be able to sleep at night.\u201d The reality star fully believed she was going to die, and now she no longer cares about possessions and materialistic items.\n\nKardashian also discussed life with her kids following the frightening ordeal in Paris, and said her 1-and-a-half year-old son Saint is her \u201c10,\u201d which the audience member understood to mean is a \u201cperfect baby.\u201d And, after DeGeneres asked about West and his well-being, Kardashian noted that the rapper\u2019s 40th birthday is on June 8, and she\u2019s still struggling with what she should do to mark his milestone. At that point, we\u2019re told, the talk show host offered to host the entire Kardashian family for a one-hour birthday party. No word yet whether Kardashian will take DeGeneres up on the invitation.
