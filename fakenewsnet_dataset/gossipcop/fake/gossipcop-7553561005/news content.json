Under the headline, \"Drake Hits The Brakes At Haunted Houdini House!\" the tabloid reports:However, the website Gossip Cop doubts the story, citing the \"suspicious language\" of the tipster. But as I can't seem to find the original story at, I'm wondering if Gossip Cop invented the story just so they could debunk it. Fake news creating fake news to debunk it as fake news? My head hurts.Of course, the house in Laurel Canyon only has a tenuous connection to Houdini, as I covered in this 2012 post. But it has drawn many celebrities and rock stars over the years. Although most have managed it better than scaredy cat Drake!", "images": ["https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-u67Bq1pdep8/XeKc4S3fiBI/AAAAAAAAzSU/JWZfNKE8PIEpr0SbbxwvIuSDs3PyOP4pQCLcBGAsYHQ/w72-h72-p-k-no-nu/IMG_2352.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CcKFA6GYhek/WVBdgbwBJEI/AAAAAAAApHw/_YXl74jhLoQ0VltWT7bh1zLVFMzSYLtygCK4BGAYYCw/s1600/resize-5%2Bcopy.jpeg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_o_5Z3Zpfj0M/TRo0idHidBI/AAAAAAAAA30/KExNFJfj2uo/S250/greathoudinis.jpg", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jcsqDvXhDfyVkQVdWhgHou91jgu5RKGBrZp3DEYTs90XCjOix_iSqH03bPQ7KDRKklgxtfDt0NoZTHeBwLflLjwoYV-2a7tyfNJej9YIWbXNn_elY_QucQg2x4757pw5JpcszhM_u3lOVX-_EnBjmFoBJtwefL7O2WjncU1TD-4PupoK0Xe_rot9IhtP9NpF3AWmaGQQPQumeJQvPN-kBLt9an5XXEBsupvgUG6a85Gj14AtxT1PIugoDc1RhrS042ZS29BWVQzqUdqfQv3tkxZjL7ajaoYaMWCRKI4Vk4sF_eoUEbDWKSDJ55KJlD7c05no1q7zxCd4ZfQLZxTgnE_RVTclbLaqqIci4HBAMNKFXP9np3taFNUAQ_2Dr4Pp51qV82zxX0NxXYGasEvpLRBOb1zl_xE9mJlFv-75vDsfImJzCjDHcgjFV9OCDHQ1JSF5H50f_PiTb4UXJhxl7fVcOtVqmDgA5t2qhLHcrPvd8m0hkdIjVGgEBjxri5hYm2cLDmWco73ez_5tvaJ3F21VoKDdNr6wPSkBSKxEw297A36aSYh2BzFIdUhyp5PC5WL6zzUKFPtLTR2s5A9cJKCaRx1cejCMZNAOCCB2Jv8CygW5tDZcF8j5wV_i2Vd8De7O2ZYT2YWApFVPTGNc3ZjjZl2AzdXkr9S81-JVp8CLzbXpbiOJKYIp=w371-h500-no", "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Srok9pHhMxU/WVU1-OukJ3I/AAAAAAAApNc/jGYHXE0JKMYL161fJNahV_wOHoEl6fAMwCLcBGAs/s400/drake.jpg", "https://resources.blogblog.com/img/icon18_edit_allbkg.gif", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-K63eFl-xNFw/TvjD9fapUbI/AAAAAAAAFIM/7pNqzRS-BCk/s250/dda4.jpeg", "https://resources.blogblog.com/img/icon18_wrench_allbkg.png", "https://resources.blogblog.com/img/icon18_email.gif", "https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_o_5Z3Zpfj0M/TSIsLfLxSyI/AAAAAAAAA-o/wQNFsppC-vg/w72-h72-p-k-no-nu/buried+alive.jpg", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JmRM_k63qk09lFAuICm5Y2MPfviOm27Md3gVZHzEoX1AxB2TLKPiGpaQEljG_PDM4F-OuADfNoKSLcrZV9OoW9JhEUm2FLB-wUVmD1lX3RHbmk-VE91XeTYRn25vDAG4WJ4ZC5OV4qjkhcqECPHLxsNNMq-YaW3M1TnYIwEYHNHn__7xcdtfLOUnqkb8uygJbcZ2nCTEzm18PE9snJoCfZOfvOmy2BxHushhnrc0QIm0cEmcBax1WjphpqBL1UkXqghIAiX03-IY2C2GbJCH-7_BJnloO9fWVe113jTVCzjR4WLoGRxP44DGfDNmvPpMVujoprWTOHZ1qWI0TrLAWqSwqSRByqiuaotCyxhE9_Zv4fyVHTgZipk3ePlnSCY2xp3GctMY7pYwYzz79PRzHV1DIL3Ugs_Jw91NACWl2sHrC_DWlCMYOk-h0KEekQhe4eEMRvSCpUMK7UwkIZnwaMkP0tc5IK3SD9D-4BkvD8ggOeDaxG4BT8NWA9wyjaalL46X4pEdbwuKMw4rCH_g5PjRd9colmgvAJd7p8AdJ3Xg39lUdOh1BrZOo0F7WbuIcv3bP8pG4O1MZ4yipBzS11VvKui1hn2oWtOlPsHmxiMtaQYp1xU5xHFn3E5aLZTOXkVbPYOE0FaXyW1lVzBq-Cb0VfiKzVfeLYNvM2LVO8Ogymj0ENgdLdM=w491-h144-no", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_o_5Z3Zpfj0M/TRo2jCbd8ZI/AAAAAAAAA4M/tbsd9Ve5pW4/S150/tnt2.jpg", "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_w8yYZicH8g/XcoCXD34VHI/AAAAAAAAzB0/fb7V_0oMhNE1nSgTXaej257d2kZL7hpGgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Mycologne.jpg", "https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mSxYmZn64F8/W2ISXlDizeI/AAAAAAAAugs/bDg-52idxh8tBwJfAQexjV37O-aQR_bOQCPcBGAYYCw/s72-c/image%2Bsized%2Bto%2Bsite.jpeg", "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BsnW3xUl9xo/XeCCzdDvnuI/AAAAAAAAzQo/XX9KP9Q4ETcSCMi_F2B18Qwg1pXQGZz3wCLcBGAsYHQ/w72-h72-p-k-no-nu/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-11-28%2Bat%2B6.29.39%2BPM.png", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ylLhl5C05OKWtX5RGPj-iMJ2sYwmLYxYuhN65irVVZpZc2bJQEDugT2Httco5ukLGUq060MnV8AfIHE=w1366-h768-no", "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Srok9pHhMxU/WVU1-OukJ3I/AAAAAAAApNc/jGYHXE0JKMYL161fJNahV_wOHoEl6fAMwCLcBGAs/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/drake.jpg", "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bNEGnVcX-f4/W-sHdeqgePI/AAAAAAAAvm4/vTshUB2HYxIzJ9DI4fr1AC1Ngqj7UAsBQCLcBGAs/w72-h72-p-k-no-nu/Daily_News_Sun__Dec_5__1926_%2Bcopy%2B3.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_o_5Z3Zpfj0M/TRozqZaNfUI/AAAAAAAAA3s/QldevSU_pyg/S250/tonyhoudini.jpg"], "top_img": "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Srok9pHhMxU/WVU1-OukJ3I/AAAAAAAApNc/jGYHXE0JKMYL161fJNahV_wOHoEl6fAMwCLcBGAs/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/drake.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2017/06/drake-scared-away-from-haunted-houdini.html", "title": "WILD ABOUT HARRY: Drake scared away from \"haunted Houdini house\"", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=1100", "generator": "blogger", "description": "An alleged story in the National Enquirer says that rapper Drake was \"scared away\" from the fabled Houdini Esate in Laural Canyon while shooting a promotional video.", "og": {"url": "https://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2017/06/drake-scared-away-from-haunted-houdini.html", "title": "Drake scared away from \"haunted Houdini house\"", "description": "An alleged story in the National Enquirer says that rapper Drake was \"scared away\" from the fabled Houdini Esate in Laural Canyon while shooting a promotional video.", "image": "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Srok9pHhMxU/WVU1-OukJ3I/AAAAAAAApNc/jGYHXE0JKMYL161fJNahV_wOHoEl6fAMwCLcBGAs/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/drake.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.wildabouthoudini.com", "summary": ""}
