He just needs to rest for a few days and he should be good to go.\u201d\n\nSo what prompted the trip to the hospital? Apparently, Kim insisted because the couple\u2019s 2-year-old son Saint was hospitalized for pneumonia in January.\n\n\u201cKanye had been sick for a few days and didn\u2019t get better,\u201d the source explained. \u201cThey wanted to make sure that he didn\u2019t have something serious like pneumonia since they had that scare with Saint before.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West Back Grid\n\nThough he apparently wasn\u2019t feeling well, Kanye, 41, attended rapper Pusha T\u2019s wedding to longtime love Virginia Williams at the historic Cavalier Hotel in Virginia Beach on Saturday, joining A-list guests like Pharrell Williams, Fabolous, The Dream and Trey Songz.\n\nThe \u201cFlashing Lights\u201d rapper rocked a classic black tuxedo, Kim, 37, was right by his side, looking glamorous in a glittery gold minidress.\n\nLast month, Kanye released his eighth studio album, Ye.
