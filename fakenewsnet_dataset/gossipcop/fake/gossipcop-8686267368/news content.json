While the mother of two was sharing pool pics, the 55-year-old Casamigos mogul posted a photo of the beautiful view. \"Mornings like this with coffee and croissants,\" he wrote.\n\nGerber also appears to be quite good with a mango ...or is it a football?\n\nWhile Crawford's vacation pics are pretty flawless, she told New Beauty that she's seen a change in her looks over the years.\n\n\"I don't need everyone on Instagram pointing out that I don't look the same way I did when I was 20. I know that,\" she said. \"No matter what I do, I'm not going to look 20 or 30. I just want to look great for 50. I exercise, eat healthy and take really good care of my skin.\"\n\nHere's further proof that Crawford and Gerber know how to relax right:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nCindy Crawford Flaunts Bikini Body While Vacationing in Mexico With Husband Rande Gerber\n\nCindy Crawford and Rande Gerber Exchange Heartfelt Messages Celebrating Their 19th Wedding Anniversary\n\nCindy Crawford and Her Very Attractive Family Relax During Beach Vacation -- See the Gorgeous Pics!\n\nCindy Crawford Is 50 and Fabulous in Her String Bikini!
