The studio has always been my safe haven. But the ultimate goal for me is to be satisfied. I never want to be a figure of disappointment. The best quote to sum \u2018I\u2019ve never felt as though I didn\u2019t belong, I just acted as though I did.\u2019 \u2014Boy George.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Aaron Carter Says Medical Condition Is Keeping Him Skinny\n\nIt\u2019s been a dramatic summer for Carter.
