Teresa served a little over 11 months in prison herself for the same crimes and was released on Dec. 23, 2015.\n\nAccording to the source, the couple \u2014 who share daughters Gia, 17, Gabriella, 14, Milania, 12, and Audriana, 9 \u2014 \u201ccan\u2019t wait to be reunited.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese last few years have been tough on everybody,\u201d the insider adds.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest from PEOPLE?

Joe has lost 45 lbs. in prison and Teresa \u2014 who trimmed down with yoga during her own sentence \u2014 is spending plenty of time with her daughters as she takes care of the household.\n\n\u201cJoe is working out,\u201d the source says. \u201cTeresa is, too. They both look better than ever.\u201d\n\nTo celebrate Teresa\u2019s May 18 birthday, the Giudice daughters threw her a surprise party at the house with close friends and family.\n\n\u201cShe was very surprised and had no idea,\u201d the source says. \u201cJoe called during the party and wished her a happy birthday.\u201d\n\nFor Joe\u2019s May 22 birthday, he called the house and all the girls sang happy birthday to him.\n\nRELATED: Teresa Giudice: I \u2018Wouldn\u2019t Mind\u2019 Moving to Italy If Joe Gets Deported After Prison Sentence\n\nIn January, Teresa\u2019s lawyer told PEOPLE that rumors of trouble in the couple\u2019s marriage are completely false.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely sad that there are actually people out there and semi-reputable media outlets who seem to take pleasure in perpetuating horrible rumors and fake news stories about this family,\u201d said attorney James J. Leonard Jr. \u201cHaven\u2019t they been through enough? Haven\u2019t the children suffered enough? People need to let this family live their lives. Enough is enough. No one is cheating, no one is getting divorced. The truth is they can\u2019t wait to be together again.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese last few years have been very challenging and very difficult,\u201d he added. \u201cBoth Joe and Teresa have each lost a parent, have both experienced incarceration and have both been without one another for long periods of time. I can tell you from having deeply personal conversations with both of them, what they want more than anything is to be together with one another and their children and move forward to brighter days as a family.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/editorial-franchise-exclusive.png", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/teresa-joe-giudice.jpg?crop=338px%2C18px%2C1379px%2C841px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/teresa-joe-giudice.jpg?crop=338px%2C18px%2C1379px%2C841px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Charlotte Triggs", "Aurelie Corinthios"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/teresa-joe-giudice-birthdays-apart/", "title": "Teresa Giudice & Husband Joe Spend Their Birthdays Apart as Source Says He Lost 45 Lbs. in Prison", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Exclusive,Joe Giudice,Real Housewives,Real Housewives of New Jersey,Teresa Giudice,TV", "news_keywords": "Exclusive,Joe Giudice,Real Housewives,Real Housewives of New Jersey,Teresa Giudice,TV", "description": "This week, the\u00a0Real Housewives of New Jersey couple celebrated their 46th birthdays apart", "og": {"title": "Teresa Giudice & Husband Joe Spend Their Birthdays Apart as Source Says He Lost 45 Lbs. in Prison", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/teresa-joe-giudice-birthdays-apart/", "description": "This week, the\u00a0Real Housewives of New Jersey couple celebrated their 46th birthdays apart", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/teresa-joe-giudice.jpg?crop=338px%2C18px%2C1379px%2C841px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/teresa-joe-giudice-birthdays-apart/", "description": "This week, the\u00a0Real Housewives of New Jersey couple celebrated their 46th birthdays apart", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/teresa-joe-giudice.jpg?crop=338px%2C18px%2C1379px%2C841px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/teresa-joe-giudice-birthdays-apart/", "title": "Teresa Giudice & Husband Joe Spend Their Birthdays Apart as Source Says He Lost 45 Lbs. in Prison", "description": "This week, the\u00a0Real Housewives of New Jersey couple celebrated their 46th birthdays apart", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/teresa-joe-giudice.jpg?crop=338px%2C18px%2C1379px%2C841px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://people.com", "summary": ""}
