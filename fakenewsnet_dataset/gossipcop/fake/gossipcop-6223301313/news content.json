HL found out exclusively!\n\nThere\u2019s no denying Jennifer Lopez, 48, and Alex Rodriguez, 42, have an adorable relationship \u2014 but are they determined to take their love to the next level? While marriage may in fact be in the picture, apparently they\u2019re completely satisfied with the amount of kids they each already have! Jennifer, after all, has 9-year-old twins Max and Emme, and A-Rod is the proud father of daughters Ella, 9, and Natasha, 13. Either way though, Jennifer and Alex\u2019s connection has never been stronger!

After all, the two are practically inseparable and TOTAL couples goals! But don\u2019t count on the stars\u2019 possible nuptials being a drawn-out affair.\n\n\u201cNow when it comes to getting married, that is more likely. But they both have decided they wouldn\u2019t want a long engagement so when that happens, they want to get married very fast afterwards,\u201d our insider explained. \u201cIt\u2019s all a matter of timing since their schedules are so demanding, but one thing is for sure, their relationship is going amazingly well.\u201d We totally believe it too! Just two weeks ago, the singer and her man stepped out for a GUESS party, and they looked beyond infatuated with each other while sitting side-by-side.\n\nTell us, HollywoodLifers \u2014 do you think Jennifer and Alex SHOULD have more kids?
