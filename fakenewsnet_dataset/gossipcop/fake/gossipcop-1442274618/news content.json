Without Bieber, though, the chart-topping tune would still be nonexistent -- or may have never even come to fruition.\n\n\u201cThat was a song I had written for Divide. It just wouldn\u2019t have made it,\" Sheeran explained in an interview with Carson Daly on 97.1 AMP Radio Monday morning (Jan. 9). \"And then Justin took it and did his thing on it, and released it as a single and made it what it is. So going from a song that would have never been released to [being] the biggest song of last year -- it just became Billboard's #1 of 2016 of the whole year, and [was] nominated for Song of the Year at the GRAMMYs -- it just shows you that you shouldn\u2019t always write stuff off.\u201d\n\nSheeran didn't elaborate on what kind of touch Bieber had on the song, but he made sure to give the Purpose singer some credit. \"[Justin] did have input on it, I wouldn\u2019t say it was just all me.\"\n\nThose who pay close attention to Bieber's Twitter may have noticed that Sheeran also had a role in another one of the Bieb's 2016 hits: the Major Lazer/M\u00d8 collaboration \"Cold Water.\" But before Sheeran actually heard the track, he didn't realize he had written yet another smash for Bieber.\n\n\u201c\u2018Cold Water\u2019 was a weird one because I didn\u2019t even know that song existed,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt was a song I must\u2019ve half-written somewhere at a time where I was writing a lot of songs and I did it at Benny Blanco\u2019s house and then I got an email from Diplo just being like, \u2018Yo! That \u2018Cold Water\u2019 song is dope! Can I have it?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u2019 so I just didn\u2019t reply. And then he emailed and was like, \u201cYo, Justin [Bieber] wants to hop on the \u2018Cold Water\u2019 song. Is that cool?\u2019 And I\u2019m just like, \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019... And then the song came out and it was number one and I was like \u2018Oh, that song!\u2019 I remember doing it, but it was really, really slow. I remember hearing it and being like \u2018That kind of sounds like me. Oh wait, it was me.'\"\n\nWhile fans may never get to hear Sheeran's versions of \"Cold Water\" or \"Love Yourself\" -- though he did give one live performance of the latter in December -- they did get a sneak peak last week of what's to come with Divide. Sheeran released \"Castle on the Hill,\" an homage to his hometown of Suffolk, England, and the sexually charged \"Shape of You,\" which both shot to the top of iTunes on Friday (Jan. 6), and set a Spotify record in their first 24 hours of release.\n\nSheeran revealed on Jan. 12 that Divide will be dropping March 3, and has previously said that he will be sharing a few more new tunes from the LP prior to its release.
