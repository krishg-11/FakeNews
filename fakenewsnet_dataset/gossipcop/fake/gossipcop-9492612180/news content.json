Please tell me,\u201d read the statement, in response to a MediaTakeOut rumor speculating that the expectant singer had undergone lip injections. \u201cDid you know that in addition to weight gain there is often a dramatic change in the blood flow in the system and increased fluid causing swelling?\u201d\n\nContinues Noel-Schure, \u201cDo you know that often women\u2019s gums get swollen? Do you know that it sometimes affects our speech, our ability to chew intently and a host of other things?\u201d\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

picking on a pregnant lady is tantamount to possessing the coldest, despicable heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou need to find something else to do with your time and maybe stop by a store that has happiness
