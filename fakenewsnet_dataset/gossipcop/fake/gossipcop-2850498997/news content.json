The reality star and her husband, Kanye West, flew to Paris to see designer Virgil Abloh\u2019s debut Louis Vuitton fashion show, but Kanye had another outburst and it pushed Kim over the edge.\n\n\u201cKim\u2019s emotions were heightened,\u201d a source tells In Touch. And apparently, Kanye wasn\u2019t helping. After the show on June 21, Kanye \u201cmade a scene,\u201d according to the source, when he leaped from his front-row seat into the arms of Virgil. \u201cKim didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d the source explains, adding that the rapper burst into tears. \u201cKanye acting up just added to her anxiety.\u201d\n\nKanye\u2019s latest incident comes just a month after his controversial slavery comments and tweets about Donald Trump. Kim has apparently had enough of it, and told her family that she\u2019s considering leaving her husband. \u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d says one insider. \u201cShe\u2019s realized he\u2019s not the man she fell in love with.\u201d But a divorce may be complicated for the couple, who have $300 million empires combined. \u201cKim wants her old life back,\u201d the source says, but she\u2019s too scared to fight with Kanye.\n\nHowever, in a recent interview with The New York Times, the Ye artist admitted to thinking the future of his marriage was up in the air. He told the publication that he had a \u201creal conversation\u201d with his wife following the controversial appearance he gave on TMZ Live. \u201cThere was a moment where I felt like after TMZ, maybe a week after that, I felt like the energy levels were low, and I called different family members and was asking, you know, \u2018Was Kim thinking about leaving me after TMZ?\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nFor Kim, \u201cit\u2019s gotten to the stage where her freedom is more important than being trapped in a bad marriage,\u201d the source tells In Touch. \u201cShe\u2019s sick of walking on eggshells.\u201d But will Kanye West be able to handle a divorce? \u201cHe\u2019s strong enough now,\u201d the insider says.\n\nFor more on this story, pick up the latest issue of In Touch Weekly, on newsstands now!", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Felicity-Jones-Pregnant.jpg?crop=0px%2C76px%2C2085px%2C2085px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-divorce.jpg?resize=750%2C559", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/90-DF-Jesse-Meester-Reacts-to-Avery-and-Angelas-Tell-All-Feud.jpg?crop=0px%2C39px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/90-Day-Fiance-Star-Nicole-Jimenos-BF-01.jpg?crop=53px%2C39px%2C1906px%2C1080px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Meghan-King-Edmonds-Ready-to-Date-After-Jim-Edmonds-Divorce.jpg?crop=0px%2C78px%2C2770px%2C1572px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kendall-hadid.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/khloe-kardashian-suffocating-tristan-thompson.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jamie-Otis-Claps-Back-at-Mom-Shaming-Sometimes.jpg?crop=0px%2C294px%2C3857px%2C2183px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tristan-thompson-prince-publicity-stunt.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/it-1828-june-27.jpg?w=1180&crop=1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Olivia-Jade-and-Isabella-Gianulli-Dreading-Holidays-Amid-Mom-Lori-Loughlin-Legal-Battle-01.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/meghan-markle-prince-harry-kate-middleton-prince-william-reunite.png?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/princess-beatrice-cancels-engagement-party-amid-prince-andrew-scandal.jpg?crop=0px%2C428px%2C3516px%2C1990px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Celebs-With-the-Most-Outrageous-Demands-in-Hollywood-Promo.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-divorce.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/an-unexpected-killer-larry-swartz-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2550px%2C1444px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Biel-Pushed-Justin-Timberlake-Make-a-Public-Statement-PDA-Scandal-Promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Baby-to-Age-4-See-Baby-Chanel-Nicole-Transformation-Over-the-Years-landing-01.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C2000px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tara-Reid-Transformation-Promo.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jesse-Meester-Tom-Brooks-Bonded-Over-Darcey-Silva-Drama-01.jpg?crop=2px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-divorce.jpg?resize=750%2C559", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Editorial Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-divorce-ending-marriage-162453/", "title": "Is Kim Kardashian Divorcing Kanye West?
