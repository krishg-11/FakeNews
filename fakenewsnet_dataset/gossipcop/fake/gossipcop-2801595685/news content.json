Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie will set their differences aside, as a new report claims the exes have agreed to spend Christmas TOGETHER with the kids.\n\nThis may just be the best news we\u2019ve heard all day! Despite going through a bitter divorce, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie will reportedly spend Christmas TOGETHER for the sake of their six children \u2014 Maddox, 16, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 9. Isn\u2019t that great?! \u201cThey\u2019re not getting back together, but that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t celebrate as a family,\u201d a source told OK! Magazine. \u201cIt will be the first time in a long time that they\u2019ve all been in the same room together, so it\u2019s likely to be bittersweet.\u201d The report goes on to say that Brad has always liked to spoil his children, so Angelina \u201csoftened to the idea of him playing Santa\u201d on Christmas morning.\n\n\u201cThe holidays make Brad really sentimental about family and especially about his kids. Pampering them makes him feel good, and Angie doesn\u2019t want to interfere with that,\u201d the source further explained. And in what may be a way of repaying her, Brad and his production company Plan B will reportedly \u201cstep out and publicly support\u201d Angie\u2019s movie First They Killed My Father. \u201cAfter their split, Angie lost a lot of studio friends who sided with Brad,\u201d the source said. \u201cHis support would go a long way toward mending their friendship.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrad and Angie still care a lot about each other and by now, both want to be kind. The holiday season is the perfect time for new beginnings,\u201d the source concluded.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do YOU think Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie should spend Christmas together with the kids?
