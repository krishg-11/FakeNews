In the final part of our unmissable series, she reveals how William fell for Kate Middleton, but was scared of becoming too attached...\n\nDespite her good looks, Kate Middleton appears to have left little impression on the academic staff at St Andrews university.\n\n\n\n\u2018She was another girl in a pashmina,\u2019 says one tutor candidly.\n\n\u2018When I read about her charismatic personality \u2014 well, maybe it\u2019s developed, but it wasn\u2019t that obvious then.\u2019\n\nSome of her fellow female students even admit to having felt slightly sorry for her. While others were having the time of their lives, Kate diligently went to lectures and seemed to put in more work than most.\n\nStunning: Her daring hemline exposing her toned thighs, Kate heads out to a nightclub during her split from Prince William\n\nIndeed, she struck some who shared history of art seminars and tutorials with her as seeming rather shy and vulnerable. She didn\u2019t hang around with the girls in her year \u2014 and didn\u2019t seem to like the ones that hung around Prince William.\n\nUnlike many of them, Kate wasn\u2019t a Sloane Ranger or a \u2018Ya\u2019, didn\u2019t speak with an exaggerated upper-class accent and had no airs and graces. Most of the time, she didn\u2019t even wear make-up.\n\nIn short, she didn\u2019t stand out \u2014 and this quality alone was a potent part of her allure to Prince William.\n\n\n\nUnlike many of the girls who tried to catch the royal eye, she never looked as if she was trying too hard.\n\nHaving been educated at Marlborough College, a mixed-sex public school, Kate Middleton was relaxed around men. But William, who\u2019d been largely educated at boys\u2019 schools, clearly found the female sex somewhat alarming \u2014 particularly in his history of art tutorials, where there were seven girls to two men.\n\nWilliam, who\u2019d been largely educated at boys\u2019 schools, clearly found the female sex somewhat alarming\n\nProfessor Brendan Cassidy, his first tutor, recalls: \u2018William seemed very uncomfortable with the girls, and in the second or third week, the other man didn\u2019t turn up for the tutorial \u2014 so William was there with seven women. His body language said it all: he tried to wrap himself up [with his arms].\u2019\n\nBut he didn\u2019t find Kate threatening at all; in fact, she struck William as one of the least pushy of the girls he encountered in his first year.\n\n\n\nAs well as going to the same history of art lectures, they also had rooms in the same hall of residence. Before long, they discovered they were both sports enthusiasts. So, as the friendship developed, they swam and surfed together, played tennis on the university courts and went to pubs and wine bars.\n\nShe had a quiet, confident presence and laughed easily \u2014 but Kate had acquired a boyfriend, fourth year student Rupert Finch, and William\u2019s eye was roving elsewhere. There seemed little chance, in short, that they\u2019d ever be more than good friends.\n\nBy a remarkable coincidence, one of the first things that William discovered he had in common with Kate was that they\u2019d both been on expeditions to Chile the year before. Kate\u2019s trip had followed immediately after William\u2019s, so they knew many of the same people and could compare notes, share stories and laugh about the discomforts.\n\nHaving fun: Prince William at a ball held by members of the Tynedale Hunt at Welton Hall, near Stamfordham, Northumberland. The girl in the picture has not been identified\n\nIt had been Prince Charles\u2019 idea for him to spend part of his gap year taking part in Operation Raleigh, which takes young people from a mixture of countries and backgrounds and gives them the chance to explore, face major challenges and do some good.\n\nBefore leaving on the 11-week trip, William met Malcolm Sutherland, a Raleigh expedition leader, for a briefing at St James\u2019s Palace.\n\n\u2018He was in jeans and T-shirt \u2014 scruffy,\u2019 recalls Malcolm. \u2018He\u2019d just been dragged out of bed and he was sitting there with his cup of tea and his Sunblest white-bread toast. It was in a sitting-room upstairs \u2014 tiny, very casual, with computer games in the corner.\u2019\n\nMalcolm warned him that conditions would be extremely tough, with the volunteers expected to sleep in tents or on floors in community projects.\n\nBy the time William flew out to Chile, he was very apprehensive. It was the first time he\u2019d spent any significant time away from home, and he knew that some of his team-mates would be from backgrounds that were very different from his own.\n\nOn arrival in Patagonia, he barely spoke. The first task was a three-week journey by two-man sea kayaks, in which members carried all their food and water, with nights spent under the stars.\n\n\n\nFood was porridge for breakfast, dry biscuits and tinned sardines for lunch, and dehydrated rations for supper.\n\nTo everyone\u2019s dismay, there was day after day of driving rain and icy winds. For five nights, they were stranded on a beach while a raging storm threatened to blow away their tents. Sometimes, they huddled like sardines under big tarpaulins \u2014 soaked to the skin and bitterly cold.\n\nNot all that surprisingly, one of the party lost the plot. He was an English boy from a Youth at Risk programme, with a typical profile: serious family problems, a history of drugs and no experience of life outside the deprived squalor of the inner city.\n\nShouting and swearing aggressively, he began lashing out. It was a shocking and intimidating display, and no one knew how to handle it. Except William.\n\n\u2018You\u2019d expect someone like William to let someone else deal with it. But he connected with that boy and was the only person that could,\u2019 says Malcolm.\n\n\u2018He told him to sort himself out, but in such a way that they became very good friends afterwards. William became the only person the guy would want to talk to if there were issues \u2014 he acted as a sort of go-between.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think I could have done it at that age \u2014 to be able to go to an 18 or 19-year-old with a shaved head, who\u2019d had a hell of a tough upbringing and a drug issue and who was really, really angry. He got so much respect from that.\n\n\u2018Instead of going into his shell, as lots of people did, William energised the group, tried to keep things going, had a joke. Every project group relies on people like that, but I wouldn\u2019t have predicted [he\u2019d be one of them].\u2019\n\nClose: Prince William and Kate on their graduation day. During their time at St Andrews they attended the same history of art lectures and had rooms in the same hall of residence\n\nThe next three weeks were spent in a small coastal village called Tortel, where William helped out in the primary school.\n\n\n\n\u2018He was completely and utterly at one with himself and happy to be with (the kids) and to make a fool of himself and look silly; there was no pretence,\u2019 says Malcolm. \u2018It was his true self popping out.\n\n\u2018That was the one time his smile was non-stop. He was buzzing, he was natural, he was jumping around as if nobody was watching him. He was teaching a bit of English, playing games, drawing animals on a blackboard and writing the English name next to them; his drawings weren\u2019t too great and everyone was laughing at that.\u2019\n\nFor the final three weeks, William lived in a tent \u2018in the middle of nowhere\u2019, tracking and monitoring the area\u2019s Huemul deer, now in danger of extinction. Finally, there was a giant party before everyone flew back to their vastly differing lives.\n\n\n\n\u2018It was a massive blow-out, lots of dancing and people swinging from the rafters \u2014 and he was one of them. He got on the plane with a very sore head,\u2019 says Malcolm.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m sure he\u2019d been homesick. But by the end, he\u2019d made friends and was very comfortable with everyone. I think it gave him great confidence.\u2019\n\nWorryingly, however, William\u2019s confidence appeared to trickle away when he embarked on his four-year degree at St Andrews. Dr Corner, the registrar who looked after his non-academic welfare, thinks the Prince was lonely.\n\nHe shrank from curious stares, deliberately sitting in the front row at lectures so no one could turn round to look at him, and wearing a baseball cap and an Aston Villa scarf in the street.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile his protection team, trying to blend in and look like students, stood out a mile.\n\n\u2018The protection people were a scream: they dressed like Seventies students in cords and jackets,\u2019 says Dr Corner.\n\nThat year, the Prince spent most weekends away and seriously considered dropping out. The accepted wisdom is that he was homesick, but Corner \u2014 who met him for a chat every three weeks \u2014 thinks the real problem was self-doubt.\n\nIn his view, the Prince was finding the other part of his course, social anthropology, very challenging.\n\n\u2018Social anthropology is very theoretical and William is quite a practical person,\u2019 he says. \u2018St Andrews has lots of very bright students. I remember my own experience of going to Oxford from a Birmingham school; you talk to your peers and they all seem to know more than you do.\n\n\u2018And it was that sort of reaction, partly. He\u2019s not the brightest student we\u2019ve ever had, but he was always conscientious.\u2019\n\n'Not the brightest student we've ever had': Prince William at St Andrews University library in 2004. Tutors there say he struggled with the social anthropology elements of his further education\n\nOver the year, the Prince had many conversations about dropping out with his father and Prince Philip, both of whom tried to dissuade him. In the end, he decided to stay \u2014 and from his second year onward, he was much happier.\n\nWith Kate and two other friends, he rented a smart flat in Hope Street, an area where many parties went on noisily into the night. But not all the flats were rented by students: one was the home of a lecturer called Dana.\n\n\u2018The poor girl was plagued with students partying three times a week,\u2019 says Dr Cassidy.\n\n\u2018She was really suffering, on the verge of tears because she couldn\u2019t sleep. One night, she got up and knocked on the door of one to ask them to keep the music down \u2014 and who was in the hallway but William.\u2019\n\nDana\u2019s plea apparently failed to make a blind bit of difference.\n\nSo comfortable did William feel with his three new flatmates that they continued to live together for the rest of his time at St Andrews. Dr Corner reflects: \u2018I think it was because he was lonely that he became so close to the group. He needed them and they were incredibly protective.\n\n\u2018I remember seeing them once in Anstruther (a fishing village). He\u2019d gone to get some fish and chips and I saw a local weaving his way up the road, pointing a finger and cursing and muttering.\n\n\u2018It was very interesting to see their group movement. They almost formed a shell around William, and I thought: how mature for kids of that age.\u2019\n\nAnd Kate? Sometime during that second year, she became more than a friend.\n\nKate in a sheer black lace dress over a bandeau bra and black bikini bottoms at a university charity fashion show attended by Prince William\n\nWilliam was now clearly enjoying student life. He never went too far out of his comfort zone \u2013 all the friends he made had been to public schools \u2014 but like any other student, he dressed in jeans or chinos, wore a collection of bracelets around his wrist, drank too much and cracked jokes with his friends \u2014 memorably, on one occasion, over a sex toy that one of his hostesses had been given for her birthday.\n\nLike other students, of course, he had opportunities to take drugs \u2014 but it\u2019s highly unlikely that he ever gave into temptation.\n\nA friend of William and Harry\u2019s says: \u2018The idea of Harry being the wild one and William the good one is nonsense: they were both wild. William lets his hair down and puts down some serious drink on occasion \u2014 certainly he did as a student.\n\n\u2018He likes a good night out with his friends, but he\u2019s always quite careful to protect his image. You get p***** \u2014 so what? Nobody cares. You take drugs, and it tarnishes you for ever if you\u2019re going to be King.\u2019\n\nSome nights, William and his housemates stayed in, taking it in turns to do the cooking. They also shared all the household chores, including shopping for food \u2014 a novelty for the young Prince\n\nFinally, William was achieving his dream of \u2014 almost \u2014 blending in. Casting aside his baseball cap, he began walking confidently through the town, popping in and out of shops, pubs and caf\u00e9s with barely a second thought; he also started speaking up in tutorials and seminars.\n\nHistory of art was dropped in favour of geography, but only after he\u2019d made a long list of pros and cons. One of the cons, surprisingly, was that he\u2019d rarely been able to visit major art galleries.\n\nIn the first semester, his tutor Brendan Cassidy had asked students to compare two pictures that hang in the National Gallery.\n\n\u2018I never twigged, of course, that William couldn\u2019t just walk in,\u2019 he recalls.\n\n\u2018I asked if he\u2019d seen the pictures, assuming he had, and he said, no, he\u2019d never been in the National Gallery. If I\u2019d been smart, I should have given him an essay on something at Windsor and he could have borrowed something from Granny\u2019s collection.\u2019\n\nIn the event, geography was a far better fit.\n\n\u2018I think he surprised himself with his ability to cope with the quantitative, mathematical side of geography,\u2019 says his academic adviser, Colin Vincent.\n\n\u2018He had a view he couldn\u2019t do it. His father had been concerned that, like him, he didn\u2019t have a quantitative brain.\u2019\n\nHis geography tutor, John Walden, recalls that William was most motivated by the parts of the course with a social context \u2014 such as studies on HIV and Aids. Once, the Prince went on a \u2018human geography\u2019 field trip to Dundee.\n\nHe was in a street, discussing low-quality housing with other students, says Walden, \u2018when someone in a flat three floors above threw open the window and, in the broadest of accents, told the group, including the future King, to go f*** themselves.\u2019\n\nOn another field trip, this time to the Jostedalen ice-cap in western Norway, William let his hair down in the evenings when everyone gathered for hearty stews.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s a born raconteur.\u2019 says Dr Charles Warren, who led the group of 15 students \u2018He told some highly entertaining anecdotes about the goings-on behind the scenes at royal dos \u2014 the imminent disasters and chaos.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s this image he painted of the swan effortlessly gliding past while lots of frantic paddling is going on underneath the surface. He told [the stories] in such an amusing and entertaining way, we were all in stitches.\u2019\n\nWhen it came to writing essays, however, William didn\u2019t join other students in the library, where it was hard to escape unwanted attention. Instead, he\u2019d do them in a room at the top of the local police station.\n\nFor their last two years at St Andrews, William and Kate and their two housemates rented a stone cottage about a mile to the west of the town. With open countryside to walk in without fear of being spotted, and open fires at home, it provided the perfect sanctuary for the couple to explore their relationship further.\n\nShe also had a solid sense of her own self-worth. When someone remarked that Kate was very lucky to be going out with the Prince, she didn\u2019t hesitate before replying: \u2018He is very lucky to be going out with me.\u2019\n\nUnlike other students, William was continually being reminded of the world outside because his family were so often in the news\n\nEventually, William began accompanying Kate on visits to her parents, Michael and Carole, in Berkshire, where he delighted in the relaxed atmosphere of their red-brick house.\n\n\n\nIn the kitchen, family members clattered about or sat down for chatty, friendly meals together. It was all a revelation to a Prince who\u2019d never experienced intimate family meals while he was growing up. But there was, of course, a limit to how normal William\u2019s life could ever be.\n\nUnlike other students, he was continually being reminded of the world outside because his family were so often in the news. And during his final year, just as his first set of exams was looming, it was his brother\u2019s turn to make headlines.\n\nDuring the Christmas vacation, both Harry and William had been to a fancy dress party in Wiltshire, with the dress theme \u2018colonial and native\u2019. William had dressed as a lion and Harry \u2014 then 20 \u2014 had donned a German desert costume, complete with Nazi arm-band, that he\u2019d found in a local fancy-dress shop.\n\nSomeone at the party took a photograph, which the Sun newspaper ran \u2014 under the headline \u2018Harry the Nazi\u2019 \u2014 shortly before Holocaust Memorial Day, in which the Royal Family were taking a leading role.\n\nThere was immediate uproar. Some of Harry\u2019s critics even suggested he wasn\u2019t fit to attend Sandhurst, where he was due to start training later in the year.\n\nFar from home, with his brother in distress, William was clearly distraught \u2014 to the point where he considered asking for this to be held in account when he sat his exams the following month. Dr Walden reveals: \u2018William had obviously spent a lot of time talking to his brother and not revising for exams, and so he came to me and said: \u201cI\u2019m having a bit of a crisis. What do I do about my exams?\u201d\n\n\u2018He was really wound up about the way the press was treating his brother. It was obvious that he was very upset, so we had a conversation.\u2019 The upshot was that William sat the first tranche of his finals in January 2005, without any special dispensation. He graduated a few months later with a respectable 2:1 degree.\n\nDr John Walden, whose speciality is climate change, urged him \u2018to go off\u2019 and become a major figurehead for the issue \u2014 \u2018Your mum would have liked that, I said \u2014 but he wasn\u2019t having any of it,\u2019 he says sadly. \u2018He was going to go off and do his military training.\u2019\n\nEngagement: Prince William and Kate pose in one of two official engagement portraits\n\nAfter the couple left St Andrew\u2019s, Kate had her first real taste of what it was like to inhabit William\u2019s world. For months on end, she was followed by photographers day and night.\n\nThe royal household was enormously impressed by how composed and sensible she remained, despite enormous provocation.\n\n\n\nAsked to report any problems to them, Kate would say almost apologetically: \u2018I don\u2019t want to make a fuss but there are 20 men camped outside my apartment and they\u2019re there all day and night.\u2019\n\nThere were other ordeals ahead. Although only one of William and Kate\u2019s break-ups became public, there were other times when the relationship cooled.\n\nThe problem was William: he had very real worries about whether it was possible to love just one woman. After his hurricane childhood, he was understandably cautious about committing to a relationship.\n\nIn his early years, he\u2019d also lost many people he was close to, starting with the sudden disappearance of his beloved nanny. Subconsciously, he may have been wary of allowing himself to become too attached to Kate, in case she too abandoned him.\n\n\n\nTheir most public break-up, in 2007, was initiated by William, when he was serving with the Blues and Royals in Dorset while Kate was in London. They scarcely saw each other; there were days off when he chose to go clubbing with his friends in London \u2014 without seeing her. Unsurprisingly, there had been arguments.\n\nIt\u2019s likely he was feeling a bit claustrophobic: after all, they\u2019d been together since the age of 20 and Kate had always wanted rather more commitment than he was prepared to give.\n\nNor were all his friends that keen on her: some thought she was a bit too sensible and serious, and that she disapproved of their wilder antics.\n\nMeanwhile, William was all too aware that he hadn\u2019t had any other serious relationship before meeting Kate.\n\nWhat brought him running back, according to someone who knows him well, was jealousy. Although his girlfriend had been miserable, she hadn\u2019t sat moping at home but had hit the town night after night, wearing a brave face and a sexy dress.\n\nWhat was sauce for the goose was definitely not sauce for the gander. William is quite old-fashioned in his outlook, and he realised he couldn\u2019t bear the thought of her with another man. But it was another three-and-a-half years before he proposed.\n\nUnlike his father, who married Diana without getting to know her, William waited until he was utterly sure that the marriage would last.\n\nThe wedding day went without a hitch. That night, at Buckingham Palace, Harry provoked tears of laughter among the guests with tales from their childhood of being beaten up by William and shot at with an air rifle. But there were emotional moments too, when both boys got up to make moving tributes to their mother.\n\n\n\nPrince William kisses Kate on the balcony of Buckingham Palace following their wedding on April 29, 2011\n\nAs Kate and William took off from Buckingham Palace by helicopter the next morning, everyone assumed they were going somewhere exotic for their honeymoon.\n\nIn fact, William was going straight back to his work as a search and rescue helicopter pilot, and the honeymoon was delayed for two weeks.\n\nThe reason? Before marrying, they\u2019d trawled the internet and consulted Time Out guides in search of a place that promised both privacy and spectacular diving. Having found the perfect hotel in the Seychelles, they were dismayed to find it was booked solid.\n\nThey were not, however, prepared to ask the hotel for special favours, which would undoubtedly have meant turning another couple away. \u2018There\u2019s no way we\u2019re going to do that,\u2019 said William. \u2018It could be their honeymoon.\u2019\n\nSo, like anyone else, Kate and William simply waited until the rooms were free.\n\nJust as he succeeded in becoming an almost-normal student, William is desperate to be an almost-normal prince. This means that, for the time being, he and Kate do all their own cooking and shopping.\n\nIt also means that he knew just what to say when, at a party for the 40th anniversary of Centrepoint in November 2008, he was introduced to a young woman who found herself overwhelmed by the royal presence.\n\nAfter she\u2019d stammered out a few words, William bent down and whispered: \u2018If you imagine me naked you\u2019ll be able to talk.\u2019 She burst out laughing and then the flood gates opened. She talked and talked and couldn\u2019t stop.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/12/10/01/22031750-0-image-a-53_1575939899337.jpg",
