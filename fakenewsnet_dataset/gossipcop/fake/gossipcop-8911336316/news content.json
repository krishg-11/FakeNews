Photos by Getty Images\n\nThe Ben Affleck-Matt Damon bromance is being put to the test thanks to Chris Hemsworth.\n\nThe \"Avengers\" and \"Thor\" star has been trading barbs with Batfleck on social media over which superhero actor is truly Damon's best friend. While there usually wouldn't be any questions about the subject considering the Boston-bred stars' long-standing friendship, Damon has been spending a lot of time with Hemsworth in recent months, especially since \"The Martian\" star made a cameo in last year's \"Thor: Ragnarok.\"\n\nOf course, gossip publications have noticed the budding new friendship as well, taking things a bit further by insinuating that Hemsworth is replacing Affleck as Damon's BFF. Even though Damon has defended the \"Justice League\" actor's odd back tattoo, that didn't stop Affleck from taking to Twitter over the weekend to declare that Hemsworth can have Damon if he wants.\n\n\"Hey @chrishemsworth, you can have him! I'm Team @JimmyKimmel anyways,\" Affleck tweeted, referencing Damon's faux feud with late-night host Jimmy Kimmel.\n\nChris Hemsworth puts Ben Affleck Matt Damon bromance to the test\n\nHemsworth responded with the obligatory \"Good Will Hunting\" joke and said that Damon is probably just a bigger fan of Marvel movies than DC. The \"Thor\" star also tagged Kimmel in his tweet, so you know the comic had to weigh in on the bromance situation too.\n\nSorry mate not my fault! He\u2019s just a big @Marvel fan, not @DCComics.\n\nHow do you like them apples ?. @jimmykimmel the ball is in your court. Choose wisely... https://t.co/SWe7yrHRWW \u2014 Chris Hemsworth (@chrishemsworth) April 21, 2018\n\nHemsworth wasn't happy with Kimmel siding with Batfleck, so he threatened to pull out of his appearance on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" this week during all the \"Avengers: Infinity War\" promotional festivities. Luke Hemsworth tried to slide into the spot, but the older Hemsworth brother told him that Kimmel would only break his heart.\n\nHey @jimmykimmel sounds like you\u2019ve chosen your side. Guess I\u2019m not coming on your show this week. Good luck finding another Avenger named Chris. https://t.co/I01PB03QGw \u2014 Chris Hemsworth (@chrishemsworth) April 21, 2018\n\nNot coming on my show will be another thing you and Matt have in common! @BenAffleck https://t.co/WVceazwYHW \u2014 Jimmy Kimmel (@jimmykimmel) April 22, 2018\n\nFans don't need to worry too much, though, as it sounds like the \"Thor\" actor is changing his tune and will show up this week.\n\nYou know what, @jimmykimmel ... I\u2019m coming on your show now just to upset you. https://t.co/17EZAlIFQj \u2014 Chris Hemsworth (@chrishemsworth) April 22, 2018", "images": ["https://www.metro.us/sites/default/files/metrous-logo_1_0_0.png", "https://www.metro.us/sites/default/files/main/articles/chris-hemsworth-matt-damon-ben-affleck-jimmy-kimmel.jpg", "http://www.metro.us/sites/all/themes/metrous/images/logo-footer.svg", "https://www.metro.us/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/readmetro_567.png"], "top_img": "https://www.metro.us/sites/default/files/main/articles/chris-hemsworth-matt-damon-ben-affleck-jimmy-kimmel.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.metro.us/entertainment/celebrities/ben-affleck-matt-damon-chris-hemsworth", "title": "Is Chris Hemsworth breaking up the Ben Affleck-Matt Damon friendship?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@Metro_US", "domain": "metro.us", "creator": "@Metro_US", "url": "https://www.metro.us/entertainment/celebrities/ben-affleck-matt-damon-chris-hemsworth", "title": "Is Chris Hemsworth breaking up the Ben Affleck-Matt Damon friendship?", "description": "Jimmy Kimmel also joined the bromance battle royale."}, "fb": {"pages": 711269328994010, "admins": "https://www.facebook.com/swaminathan.guru", "app_id": 1610587402522117}, "description": "The Ben Affleck Matt Damon friendship is being put to the test thanks to Avengers star Chris Hemsworth and late-night host Jimmy Kimmel.", "abstract": "The Ben Affleck Matt Damon friendship is being put to the test thanks to Avengers star Chris Hemsworth and late-night host Jimmy Kimmel.", "robots": "follow, index", "generator": "Drupal 7 (https://www.drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Metro US", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.metro.us/entertainment/celebrities/ben-affleck-matt-damon-chris-hemsworth", "title": "Is Chris Hemsworth breaking up the Ben Affleck-Matt Damon friendship?", "description": "Jimmy Kimmel also joined the bromance battle royale.", "updated_time": "2018-04-23T10:09:18-04:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.metro.us/sites/default/files/main/articles/chris-hemsworth-matt-damon-ben-affleck-jimmy-kimmel.jpg", "url": "https://www.metro.us/sites/default/files/main/articles/chris-hemsworth-matt-damon-ben-affleck-jimmy-kimmel.jpg", "type": "jpg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-04-23T08:51:50-04:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-23T10:09:18-04:00"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "b61f5efd683c4a0c8c5bd46a16efc1c7"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1524487910.0, "source": "http://www.metro.us", "summary": ""}
