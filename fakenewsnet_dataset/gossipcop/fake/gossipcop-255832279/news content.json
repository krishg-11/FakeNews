In the picture, Caitlyn \u2014 dressed in a silk robe \u2014 holds a glass of champagne while sitting on the edge of a bathtub where former wife Kris Jenner is appears to be nude and covered in bubbles.\n\n\u201cTGIF,\u201d Kardashian West captioned the shot.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for social media to react, many questioning why the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star was posting a picture of her estranged family member.\n\nImage zoom Caitlyn Jenner and Kim Kardashian West\n\nRELATED: Where Caitlyn Jenner Stands with Every Woman in the Kardashian Family\n\n\u201cPetty at its finest,\u201d commented one Instagram user on her post.\n\nOthers shared the shot on Twitter, asking, \u201cIs this Kim throwing shade at Caitlyn or is it just me?\u201c\n\nPerhaps one tweeter put it best: \u201cWHAT DOES THIS MEAN!?\u201c\n\nImage zoom Kim Kardashian West and Caitlyn Jenner Source: Caitlyn Jenner/Instagram\n\nIt has, after all, been well over a year since Caitlyn and Kardashian West spoke.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t talk to [the Kardashians] anymore. Kim, I haven\u2019t talked to in a year,\u201d Caitlyn said in November while discussing her memoir at the U.K.\u2019s Cambridge Union, according to Cambridge News.\n\nAlthough Kardashian West publicly supported Jenner\u2019s transition, she cut ties after reading her book Secrets of My Life, which alleged Kris knew more about her gender identity crisis than she\u2019s admitted \u2014 a claim Kris denies.\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

Simpson was guilty of having killed wife Nicole Brown Simpson and waiter Ron Goldman \u2014 despite having served as the NFL star\u2019s defense attorney in his 1994 murder trial.\n\n\u201cMy relationship with Caitlyn was strained,\u201d the mother of three said during the episode, which aired in October. \u201cI was just trying to be respectful. But if you talk about my dad, I will cut you.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Caitlyn Kenner and Kim Kardashian West Source: Kim Kardashian/Instagram\n\nThings surely couldn\u2019t have been helped by comments Caitlyn made in January when she admitted on ITV\u2019s Piers Morgan\u2019s Life Stories that she \u201cdidn\u2019t trust\u201d the Kardashians and chose to keep the last few pages of her memoir from them when sharing advanced copies.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want them to leak it to the press, okay?\u201d Jenner said, adding that those pages were the ones in which she wrote about her decision to have gender confirmation surgery to transition from male to female. \u201cThere was no reason for them to know about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t tell anybody. Why? It\u2019s none of their business,\u201d Jenner continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not that big a deal.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Caitlyn Jenner Reveals She Had Skin Cancer Removed from Her Nose: \u2018Always Wear Your Sunblock!\u2019\n\nThough her relationship with step-children Kourtney Kardashian and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian remains rocky, Jenner is still in daughters Kylie Jenner and Kendall Jenner\u2019s lives.
