The shockwaves of grief and denial are still sweeping through our family as we come to grips with what has happened.\n\nYou touched so many lives, maybe even more than you realized. In the past few days, we\u2019ve seen an outpouring of love and support, both public and private, from around the world. Talinda and the family appreciate it, and want the world to know that you were the best husband, son, and father; the family will never be whole without you.\n\nTalking with you about the years ahead together, your excitement was infectious. Your absence leaves a void that can never be filled\u2014a boisterous, funny, ambitious, creative, kind, generous voice in the room is missing. We\u2019re trying to remind ourselves that the demons who took you away from us were always part of the deal. After all, it was the way you sang about those demons that made everyone fall in love with you in the first place. You fearlessly put them on display, and in doing so, brought us together and taught us to be more human. You had the biggest heart, and managed to wear it on your sleeve.\n\nOur love for making and performing music is inextinguishable. While we don\u2019t know what path our future may take, we know that each of our lives was made better by you. Thank you for that gift. We love you, and miss you so much.\n\nUntil we see you again,\n\nLP", "images": ["http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/linkin-park-portrait-2007-a-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://assets.billboard.com/assets/1575555338/images/Billboard-white.svg?58e792d77f90a4008557", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/magazine_cover/public/media/Alicia-Keys-bb28-2019-jkl-billboard-400.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/linkin-park-portrait-2007-a-billboard-1548.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mary J.
