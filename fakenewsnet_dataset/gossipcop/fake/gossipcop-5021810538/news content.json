Shepard was revered in the Hollywood and theater communities for his acting and writing. He was nominated for an acting Oscar for The Right Stuff, and his play Buried Child won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1979.\n\nFellow actors and playwrights posted sentiments on social media Monday, reflecting on Shepard\u2019s impact on them and the entertainment industry.\n\nRELATED: Sam Shepard\u2019s Life in Photos\n\nActor Ethan Hawke, who co-starred with Shepard in Snow Falling on Cedars (1999) and Hamlet (2000), remembered the deceased in a statement: \u201cHe was a poet of the first order. I\u2019ve acted in many of his plays and directed \u201cA Lie of the Mind.\u201d He played my father twice on film. Some days he could be irascible. At other times he could be profoundly wise and kind. He was the writer any serious American actor of my generation cut their teeth on. It is a gross understatement to say, he will be missed.\u201d\n\nSam Shepard. Whenever he came on-screen, you knew you were in good hands. A frame from \"Days of Heaven.\" May he rest in love. pic.twitter.com/DQc0fy7EqN \u2014 Ava DuVernay (@ava) July 31, 2017\n\nWe lost a true legend today.
