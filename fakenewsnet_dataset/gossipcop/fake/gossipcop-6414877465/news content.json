Rowling were among those who spoke out about the press conference. Rowling tweeted, \u201cUp until an hour ago, the scariest thing I\u2019d ever watched was Psycho. #TrumpPresser.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis guy is so wired in front of the press,\u201d Baldwin wrote. \u201cImagine what he\u2019s like behind closed doors\u2026\u201d\n\nWhile more celebrities chimed in online, Tapper, who recently had a contentious back-and-forth with Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, reacted strongly on his network.\n\n\u201cIt was unhinged; it was wild,\u201d he declared. \u201cI can\u2019t believe there are Republicans on Capitol Hill and in the White House who don\u2019t understand that might play well with the 44 percent of the population that voted for the president, but a lot of Americans are going to watch that press conference and think, \u2018That guy is not focused on me and I don\u2019t even know what he\u2019s focused on.'\u201d\n\nWatch Tapper\u2019s full reaction below and read other celebrities sharing their thoughts.\n\nThis guy is so wired in front of the press. Like he's gonna blow a rod.\n\nImagine what he's like behind closed doors\u2026 \u2014 ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) February 16, 2017\n\n@AlecBaldwin best look for another job tonight.
