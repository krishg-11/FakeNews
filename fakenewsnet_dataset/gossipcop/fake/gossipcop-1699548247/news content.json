According to a new report, even though the A-list actress and her boyfriend, Bryan Randall, are doing perfectly, they aren\u2019t in a rush to get engaged.\n\n\u201cSandy is a bit hesitant about getting married because of the legalities,\u201d a pal of hers told Us Weekly, adding that Bryan has not yet adopted her two kids, Louis, 7, and Laila, 5. \u201cIt gets complicated.\u201d\n\nApparently, Sandra turned to her good friend Jennifer Aniston for advice, who is clearly a pro at secretive relationships and weddings. The Blind Side actress suggested she and Bryan would hold a private, small ceremony to which Jen agreed since she thinks they\u2019re basically already husband and wife. \u201cJen was saying, \u2018What\u2019s the difference? He\u2019s already living here, he\u2019s already your old man,'\u201d a source told the news outlet.\n\nPrior to Bryan, Sandra was married to Jesse James from 2005 until their messy divorce in 2010 after he admitted to a plethora of cheating scandals. \u201cShe went through a great deal of heartbreak after Jesse,\u201d says the friend. \u201cAnd she is scarred by it to this day.\u201d\n\nIt was previously revealed that despite her past heartbreak, she\u2019s found love again with Bryan. A source said, \u201cBryan takes care of her in all of the right ways. She feels loved and appreciated all of the time.\u201d Can we find a relationship like that, please?\n\nSandra, 53, and Bryan, 51, began dating in late 2015, and even though the happy couple is often busy with their careers and \u201cmost of their time revolves around the kids,\u201d they\u2019ve both made it a point to make time for each other whether it\u2019s by planning a late lunch or even an early dinner.\n\n\u201cBryan has fully stepped up and embraced the dad role,\u201d the insider adds. \u201cHe is 100 percent there for Louis and Laila and wonderful with them in every way. Sandy feels incredibly fortunate and blessed that she is sharing the parenting journey with Bryan.\u201d Here\u2019s hoping they tie the knot sooner rather than later!", "images": ["https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Tim-Mcgraw-recalls-daughter-audreys-birth.jpg?crop=0px%2C103px%2C3261px%2C3261px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/melanie-griffith-dakota-johnson.jpg?crop=330px%2C52px%2C2467px%2C1398px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/melanie-griffith-loves-antonio-banderas-.jpg?crop=0px%2C58px%2C2177px%2C1233px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CL2319_cover_cn2_View-1.jpg?w=300", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/who-is-desi-arnaz-jr.jpg?crop=485px%2C0px%2C1831px%2C1831px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Joel-Schiffman-INSTA.png?crop=0px%2C0px%2C554px%2C314px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jason-Priestley-advice2.jpg?crop=0px%2C186px%2C2400px%2C1360px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/marie-osmond-debuts-short-hair-the-talk.png?crop=341px%2C0px%2C898px%2C897px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/sandra-bullock.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sandra-bullock-botox-plastic-surgery.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Oliver-Kate-Hudson-recall-parents-having-child-1.jpg?crop=70px%2C0px%2C1852px%2C1852px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/sandra-bullock-boyfriend-bryan-randall-engaged.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/crisis-main-1.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/sandra-bullock-boyfriend-bryan-randall-engaged.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sandra-bullock.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/lets-talk-to-lucy-main.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/gilligans-island-cast.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/sandra-bullock-bryan-randall.jpg?w=1180&h=600&crop=1", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/william-frawley-fred-mertz.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/donnie-wahlberg-jenny-mccarthy-marriage-advice02.jpg?crop=54px%2C149px%2C2804px%2C1587px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/john-lennon-paul-mccartney-1.jpg?resize=120%2C68"], "top_img": "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/sandra-bullock-boyfriend-bryan-randall-engaged.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Samantha Faragalli"], "canonical_link": "https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/sandra-bullock-boyfriend-bryan-randall-engaged-120541/", "title": "Sandra Bullock Is \"Hesitant\" to Marry Boyfriend Bryan Randall", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "It seems Sandra Bullock won't be walking down the aisle anytime soon.
