However, after it was revealed that there is drama on the set between fellow judges Miley Cyrus and Jennifer Hudson, sources are also noticing a rift between Adam and Blake.\n\n\"Blake and Adam's bromance has cooled off,\" a source tells Life & Style exclusively. \"They definitely aren't as close as they once were.\" Viewers won't notice anything wrong because the friends always pretend to bicker while pitching themselves to contestants.\n\nWhen cameras are off, the friendship \"seems forced,\" a source adds. \"It's not as natural as it once was. They've definitely drifted apart.\" This news comes just as The Voice experienced one of its lowest season premieres ever. Miley and Jennifer are also struggling to connect after Miley made a joke about JHud's long engagement to David Otunga. \"Jennifer looked Miley right in the eye and told her to never mention her private life again, or even say David's name,\" an insider explains.\n\nAdam, 38, and Blake, 41, became unexpected BFFs when they met on the show as judges in 2011. \u201cI remember when I saw him at the meeting at NBC, I was instantly very taken by him \u2019cause he was definitely not your typical country artist,\u201d Adam told People magazine. \u201cHe was not a cookie-cutter guy, and the second we met, we were friends. All of the bulls\u2014 that we do comes from a place of love.\u201d\n\nBlake also couldn't stop gushing about Adam earlier this year. \"He\u2019s one of the most loving people I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d Blake said. \u201cWe drive each other nuts, but outside of this world, he\u2019s one of my best friends and it\u2019s because of his heart. He needs his face slapped around, but he has a huge, huge heart.\u201d Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end.\n\nFor more exclusive celebrity news, be sure to pick up the latest issue of Life & Style magazine, on newsstands now!", "images": ["https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LS2319_cover_ns4_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Sofia-Richie-Scott-Disick-Miami-5.jpg?crop=0px%2C340px%2C2038px%2C2038px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Priyanka-Chopra-Nick-Jonas-Exclusive.jpg?crop=0px%2C54px%2C1984px%2C1124px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emma-Stone-Engaged-to-Boyfriend-Dave-McCary-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1408px%2C1408px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/teddi-mellencamp-tips-to-conceive-feature-e1575835265340.jpg?crop=0px%2C82px%2C1393px%2C789px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Britney-Spears-singing.jpg?crop=436px%2C0px%2C1601px%2C1601px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Alessandra-Ambrosio.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1699px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gwen-stefani-not-on-voice.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jenna-Dewan-Steve-Kazee-Relationship-Timeline-Promo.jpg?crop=145px%2C0px%2C1736px%2C1736px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Hannah-Brown-and-Alan-Bersten.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C2310px%2C1309px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jeweler-Reveals-Story-Behind-Khloe-Kardashian-Infamous-True-Necklace-feat-01.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Ashley-Jared-Christmas.jpg?crop=0px%2C84px%2C3150px%2C1786px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gwen-Stefani-The-Voice-Promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C37px%2C1850px%2C1850px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_editorial_10494437ak.jpg?crop=0px%2C82px%2C2769px%2C1571px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/adam-levine-blake-shelton-bromance.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_editorial_10493811em.jpg?crop=0px%2C146px%2C3150px%2C1784px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-baby-girl.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/adam-levine-blake-shelton-bromance.jpg?resize=1000%2C600", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hannah-brown-ashley-iaconetti.jpg?crop=0px%2C25px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/screen-shot-2017-10-10-at-6-48-31-pm.png?resize=120%2C68"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/adam-levine-blake-shelton-bromance.jpg?resize=1000%2C600", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Life", "Style Magazine"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/blake-shelton-and-adam-levine-bromance-145503/", "title": "Adam Levine and Blake Shelton's Bromance \u2014 Drifting Apart on The Voice", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Fans of The Voice tune into the reality singing competition to witness Adam Levine and Blake Shelton's unlikely bromance.
