He says it\u2019s saddening and heartbreaking that she had to carry that weight for so long.\n\nSporting all black, down to his tie and his shirt, the \u201cFeud\u201d star said that it was a very small gesture of solidarity but hoped that out of small gestures comes big ones.\n\nChris Sullivan of \u201cThis Is Us\u201d did not wear an all-black outfit, but painted his fingernails black for Sunday\u2019s ceremony.\n\n\u2013 Lindsey Bahr (@ldbahr) on the Golden Globes red carpet.\n\n___\n\n2:40 p.m.\n\nThe highly anticipated wear-black protest at the Golden Globes got off to an early start Sunday as soon as the red carpet opened, including Michelle Williams in an embellished off-the-shoulder look and \u201cMe Too\u201d founder Tarana Burke at her side.\n\nTurning the Globes dark on the fashion front had been anticipated for days after a call for massive reform following the downfall of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and numerous others in Hollywood, media, fashion, tech, publishing and other industries. The new initiative Time\u2019s Up, backed by more than 300 women in Hollywood, doled out pins intended for those who might already have locked in more colorful looks.\n\nAllison Williams provided a pop of orange and silver on the bodice of her black column gown.\n\nNot everybody supports the protest.

Seven other actresses, including Emma Stone and Meryl Streep, are bringing activists to the ceremony, which is the first major awards show since the sexual misconduct scandal roiled Hollywood.\n\nBoth Williams and Burke wore black dresses.

He said there was checkpoint after checkpoint and that they were not kidding around.\n\nElsewhere on the red carpet, Mario Lopez filmed an early segment and other TV reporters fanned themselves down amid the rising temperatures.\n\n\u2013 Lindsey Bahr (@ldbahr) on the Golden Globes red carpet.\n\n___\n\n12:55 p.m.\n\nTemperatures pushed into the 70s in the hours before the limousines began arriving at the Golden Globes.\n\nSecurity of all kinds lined the scene Sunday. Motorcycle officers cruised down the red carpet. A sniper in military attire put a large rifle on a tripod on a low rooftop of the Beverly Hilton Hotel.\n\nWorkers sneaked quick photos on the red carpet while they could.\n\nFans who crammed into a small set of bleachers stood and strained to see any celebrity bigger than the gathered reporters.\n\nThe red carpet is scheduled to begin at 2 p.m. Pacific, but will get busier closer to the start of the Globes ceremony at 5 p.m.\n\n\u2013 Andrew Dalton (@andyjamesdalton) in the fan bleachers outside the Golden Globes.\n\n___\n\n10:25 a.m.\n\nMeryl Streep, Michelle Williams, Emma Watson and Amy Poehler are just a few of the actresses who are planning to bring gender and racial justice activists as their guests to the Golden Globe Awards Sunday evening.\n\nStreep will attend with Ai-jen Poo, the director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, Williams with Tarana Burke, the founder of the \u201cme too\u201d movement, and Watson will bring Marai Larasi, the executive director of Imkaan, a Black-feminist organization.\n\nIn a statement Sunday, the advocates say they were inspired by the Time\u2019s Up initiative. They say the goal in attending the awards will be to shift focus away from the perpetrators and back on survivors and creating lasting change.\n\nMany attending the Golden Globes will also be wearing black to protest sexual harassment.\n\n___\n\n8 a.m.\n\nThe Golden Globes, once the stomping grounds of Harvey Weinstein, will belong to someone else this year.\n\nThe 75th Golden Globe Awards is considered wide open, with contenders including Guillermo del Toro\u2019s \u201cThe Shape of Water,\u201d Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cThe Post\u201d and Martin McDonaugh\u2019s \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.\u201d\n\nBut whoever takes home the hardware Sunday, the spotlight is unlikely to stray far from the sexual misconduct scandals that have roiled Hollywood ever since an avalanche of allegations toppled Weinstein. Out of solidarity with the victims of sexual harassment and assault, many women have said they will be dressing in black for the Globes.\n\nRed carpet arrivals are expected to begin around 5 p.m. EST, with the broadcast starting on NBC at 8 p.m. Oprah Winfrey will received the Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award.", "images": ["https://i2.wp.com/www.nbc4i.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2019/12/parchment-car-on-guy-wire-120919.jpg?resize=2560%2C1440&ssl=1",
