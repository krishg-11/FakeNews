He added, \u201cI think M. Night Shyamalan is about to show up.\u201d\n\nMontel Williams quipped, \u201cIn case you were wondering, Rachel Maddow is doing the TV equilvalent of a snail race to hold the audience.\u201d\n\nOther celebs stood up for Maddow: Star Trek alum Wil Wheaton said Maddow \u201calways gives deep context on her way into a story. It\u2019s called \u2018journalism, people.\u201d\n\nAlso backing Maddow was Billy Eichner, who wrote, \u201cTrump won cause while an intelligent woman was trying to tell us about Russian ties u complained about her presentation & here we are again.\u201d\n\nRead more reactions below.\n\nThis feels like a whole lot of hedging. #RachelMaddow \u2014 Kumail Nanjiani (@kumailn) March 15, 2017\n\nI think M.
