All the while Kylie is said to be \u201cwrapped up\u201d in being Stormi\u2019s mother, as well as focusing her cosmetic company. The alleged sources went on to claim that Kendall and Kylie can be very competitive with each other, which also causes problems.\n\nHowever, the outlet claims that all of the rumors about Kendall and Kylie Jenner\u2019s relationship are not true, citing that Kendall would have become more distant with sister Khloe Kardashian, who also welcomed a baby this year.
