I admit that at first I wanted Hillary to win, but with time I understood that America made a great choice with Donald Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand that people don\u2019t like him \u2013 I really do. At first I didn\u2019t either, but he became our President so what we need to do is stand behind him in times like this.\u201d\n\n\u201cHatred is the last thing we need nowadays, we must unite. I feel that Donald Trump is doing everything he can to improve our nation, you might just want to respect him and stay patient.\u201d\n\nEmma Stone also stated that there is nothing wrong if you give someone a chance.\u201dI don\u2019t know. I think that people need to stay patient for a while and see what happens. People are too nervous these days. There is no need for that.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s give him a chance. So far he\u2019s doing ok and I really believe that for the first time in history we have a President that can change this country for the better.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think about this?
