We are and will always be united in our support of each other and our family.\u201d\n\nFergie and Josh share four-year-old son Axl.\n\nThe stars tied the knot back in 2009 in a Catholic ceremony after becoming engaged in 2007. They first met on the set of Josh\u2019s TV show Las Vegas in 2004, when Fergie\u2019s band the Black Eyed Peas made a cameo on the series.\n\nThe news is likely to come as a shock to fans of the pair \u2013 Transformers star Josh frequently gushed about his marriage to Fergie, including in a Haute Living magazine interview in May.\n\n\u201cWe genuinely like each other,\u201d the 44-year-old told the publication when quizzed on the secret to his happy union with the M.I.L.F. $ hitmaker.\n\n\u201c(We) have a lot of love for our son and have a good time together,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd that\u2019s about it.\u201d\n\nJust a month later, in June, Josh praised Fergie\u2019s parenting skills during an interview on America\u2019s The Ellen DeGeneres Show.\n\n\u201cHaving a kid at 40 years old is much different than having one at 22, you know, so I\u2019m a little more mature than I was then,\u201d he smiled. \u201cI\u2019m just doing the best that I can, trying not to screw him up for life. You never know. (But Fergie) is definitely more evolved than I am, and more patient.\u201d", "images": ["https://api.pymx5.com/v1/sites/track?event_type=PAGE_VIEW&noscript=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/498ea01ee88beecb59be73ea42c1f3c6?s=96&d=identicon&r=g", "https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/thumbnail_img_1698-e1575929029136.png?w=205&h=153&crop=1", "https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/afp_tl4f5-e1575944173527.jpg?w=107&h=80&crop=1&quality=80&strip=all", "https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/1178072900-e1572188228454.jpg?w=107&h=80&crop=1&quality=80&strip=all", "https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/75727958-e1575929940412.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=205&h=153&crop=1", "https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/toronto-desktop.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/990309138/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://s1.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/postmedia-plugins/postmedia-geolocation/images/weather/hp_w_ion_l.svg", "http://storage.torontosun.com/v1/dynamic_resize/sws_path/suns-prod-images/1297991147858_ORIGINAL.jpg?size=520x", "https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/gettyimages-140021941-e1575925545864.jpg?w=107&h=80&crop=1&quality=80&strip=all", "https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/tuesday-letters.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=210&h=160&crop=1", "https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/10strasburg.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=365&h=273&crop=1", "https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/china-flags-toronto-e1569888849568.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=205&h=153&crop=1", "https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/gettyimages-1185778532-e1575913372530.jpg?w=107&h=80&crop=1&quality=80&strip=all", "https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/basketball-nba-chi-tor--e1575948627645.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=365&h=273&crop=1"], "top_img": "http://storage.torontosun.com/v1/dynamic_resize/sws_path/suns-prod-images/1297991147858_ORIGINAL.jpg?size=520x", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://torontosun.com/2017/09/14/fergie-and-josh-duhamel-split/wcm/7cbbe99a-43f2-4e2b-9a0f-2eb9fae5af7c", "title": "Fergie and Josh Duhamel split", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive", "description": "Singer FERGIE has separated from her actor husband Josh Duhamel after eight years of marriage.
