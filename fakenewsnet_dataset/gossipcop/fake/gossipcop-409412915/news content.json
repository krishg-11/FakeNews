It doesn\u2019t exist because it never happened. You don\u2019t get to control someone\u2019s emotional response to being called \u2018that bitch\u2019 in front of the entire world,\u201d the singer wrote on her Instagram account afterwards.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: \u2018Deeply Sorry\u2019 Katy Perry Sends Olive Branch and Sweet Letter to Taylor Swift Ahead of Tour\n\nThough the entertainers were never heard discussing the specific lyric \u201cWhy? I made that bitch famous\u201d \u2014 which Swift has consistently said is what upset her \u2014 the \u201cDelicate\u201d singer received a flood of backlash from fans calling her a liar.\n\n\u201cI went through some times when I didn\u2019t know if I was gonna get to do this anymore,\u201d she told her fans on Tuesday night before launching into \u201cLong Live,\u201d a track off her Speak Now album. \u201cI guess the snakes \u2026 I wanted to send a message to you guys that if someone uses name calling to bully you on social media and even if a lot of people jump on board with it, that doesn\u2019t have to defeat you. It can strengthen you instead.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Big Reputation!

So thank you, thank you, thank you for taking the time to get to know me, for showing up for me, for seeing me as a human being. That\u2019s you. You did that for me.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/shutterstock_editorial_9666162b_huge.jpeg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/gettyimages-956288820.jpeg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/shutterstock_editorial_9666162b_huge.jpeg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/shutterstock_editorial_9666162b_huge.jpeg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Melody Chiu"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/music/taylor-swift-tour-emotional-speech-low-times-kim-kardashian-feud/", "title": "Taylor Swift Alludes to Kim Kardashian West Feud on Tour", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Kanye West,Kim Kardashian,Music News,News,Reputation,Taylor Swift", "news_keywords": "Kanye West,Kim Kardashian,Music News,News,Reputation,Taylor Swift", "description": "The superstar thanked her fans for \"seeing me as a human being\" during her difficult times", "og": {"title": "Taylor Swift Opens Up About 'Really Low Times' While Alluding to Kim Kardashian West Feud", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/music/taylor-swift-tour-emotional-speech-low-times-kim-kardashian-feud/", "description": "The superstar thanked her fans for \"seeing me as a human being\" during her difficult times", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/shutterstock_editorial_9666162b_huge.jpeg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/music/taylor-swift-tour-emotional-speech-low-times-kim-kardashian-feud/", "description": "The superstar thanked her fans for \"seeing me as a human being\" during her difficult times", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/shutterstock_editorial_9666162b_huge.jpeg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/music/taylor-swift-tour-emotional-speech-low-times-kim-kardashian-feud/", "title": "Taylor Swift Opens Up About 'Really Low Times' While Alluding to Kim Kardashian West Feud", "description": "The superstar thanked her fans for \"seeing me as a human being\" during her difficult times", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/shutterstock_editorial_9666162b_huge.jpeg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://people.com", "summary": ""}
