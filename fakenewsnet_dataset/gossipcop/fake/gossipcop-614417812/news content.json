Hollywood\u2019s favorite power couple, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, are reportedly drafting up a mid-nuptial agreement. Why? Because Kanye\u2019s finances are a disaster, and Kimmie wants protection.\n\nAn insider told Radar Online, \u201cHe\u2019s making all kinds of deals right now that are very high stakes, and Kim\u2019s nervous.\u201d Although the pair already has an arrangement in place \u2014 which protects Kim from going down with him if he screws up \u2014 she \u201cwants everything looked over with a fine-tooth comb, especially as her kids are so involved and potentially impacted at this point.\u201d The insider added, \u201cKim\u2019s worried sick about Kanye\u2019s current situation, which has incurred millions in legal fees already and is only getting more expensive and complicated. She wants to protect herself, and for all her faults nobody could blame her.\u201d\n\nMUSE SEE: Kylie Jenner Is Reportedly Pregnant With Boyfriend Travis Scott\u2019s Baby \u2014 and Is Due in January!\n\nMORE: Kylie Jenner Helped Cut Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian\u2019s Hair and It Actually Looks Amazing\n\nPreviously, In Touch reported that the rapper, 40, is in the middle of a nasty lawsuit with his insurance company \u2014 who refuses to cover damages that are the result of his canceled Saint Pablo Tour. A source told us exclusively, \u201cThis whole lawsuit can blow up in Kanye\u2019s face because if this goes to trial, then all of his and Kim Kardashian\u2019s secrets will come out,\u201d a family insider said. \u201cKanye has opened a can of worms by launching this lawsuit. What comes out could be devastating to Kanye, his marriage to Kim, and the Kardashian family.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the hot couple is also reportedly expecting their third child together via surrogate \u2014 and seeking the help of a therapist to prepare.
