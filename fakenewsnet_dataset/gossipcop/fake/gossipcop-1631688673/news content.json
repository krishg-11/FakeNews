Everyone's praying he doesn't start drinking blood like a real vampire,\" the source said, adding, \"But no one would be surprised if he did take a swig of the stuff to make the scenes look real.\"\n\nHowever, Bale is not a part of the Dracula reboot movie neither he is planning to \"avoid sun\" for any of his Vampire related movies, Gossip Cop reported.\n\nMeanwhile, on the work front, the actor is currently busy with an upcoming period drama Hostiles.
