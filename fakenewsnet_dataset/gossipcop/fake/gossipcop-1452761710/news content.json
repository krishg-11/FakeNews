Her former manager called so often that sister Solange, 30, had to intervene. Their mom, Tina, also picked up the phone and had \"some pretty harsh words for Mathew,\" says the source.\n\nBack in May, In Touch reported that Beyonce\u0301 feared her dad would show up unannounced.\n\n\u201cShe is fearful that he\u2019ll show up uninvited like he did with [their five-year-old daughter] Blue. She doesn\u2019t want him anywhere nearby on her special day. She fully expects everything to be perfect as they become a family of five,\u201d said a source at the time.\n\nThe family \u201cdidn\u2019t want him there because they don't trust him not to leak private information about the twins \u2014 or even worse, take photos.\"\n\nIn fact, Mathew announced the birth of his grandchildren before his daughter did, and the Beyhive was furious.\n\nIn an Instagram post, he captioned the photo, \"They're here!\"\n\nMORE: Beyonc\u00e9 Welcomes Twins With Jay Z, Blue Ivy Officially a Big Sister! (REPORT)\n\nTo add to the drama, there was also some tension between Tina and JAY-Z.\n\nThe 35-year-old \"gave birth via a planned C-section, so only one person was allowed in the delivery room,\" says the source, adding that she chose her husband.\n\nTina, 63, then \"got really salty and made a comment about Jay not being home for the hard parts of Beyonce\u0301\u2019s pregnancy. She ended up leaving the hospital for a breather.\"\n\nYet now that the babies are finally here, the family of five can relax.\n\n\u201cShe is so relieved it\u2019s all over and is so happy the twins are finally here,\u201d says the source, adding that she and Jay, 47, have taken a ton of photos and videos that they plan to use in a future documentary. \u201cDespite all the drama, she really feels like her life is perfect right now.\u201d\n\nFor more on this story, pick up the latest issue of In Touch \u2014 and for more exclusive content sign up for our newsletter!\n\nMore From In Touch\n\nBeyonc\u00e9's Twins Experienced the Ultimate Diva Delivery, Obviously (EXCLUSIVE)\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 Had a \u201cHarder Time\u201d With This Pregnancy, Source Claims\n\nBeyonc\u00e9's Security Team Conducted Trial Runs for Twins' Birth (EXCLUSIVE)", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Felicity-Jones-Pregnant.jpg?crop=0px%2C76px%2C2085px%2C2085px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/meghan-markle-prince-harry-kate-middleton-prince-william-reunite.png?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jamie-Otis-Claps-Back-at-Mom-Shaming-Sometimes.jpg?crop=0px%2C294px%2C3857px%2C2183px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/an-unexpected-killer-larry-swartz-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2550px%2C1444px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/beyonce-dramatic-delivery.jpg?resize=750%2C540", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Biel-Pushed-Justin-Timberlake-Make-a-Public-Statement-PDA-Scandal-Promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/90-DF-Jesse-Meester-Reacts-to-Avery-and-Angelas-Tell-All-Feud.jpg?crop=0px%2C39px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/90-Day-Fiance-Star-Nicole-Jimenos-BF-01.jpg?crop=53px%2C39px%2C1906px%2C1080px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Baby-to-Age-4-See-Baby-Chanel-Nicole-Transformation-Over-the-Years-landing-01.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C2000px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Meghan-King-Edmonds-Ready-to-Date-After-Jim-Edmonds-Divorce.jpg?crop=0px%2C78px%2C2770px%2C1572px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/princess-beatrice-cancels-engagement-party-amid-prince-andrew-scandal.jpg?crop=0px%2C428px%2C3516px%2C1990px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tara-Reid-Transformation-Promo.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jesse-Meester-Tom-Brooks-Bonded-Over-Darcey-Silva-Drama-01.jpg?crop=2px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Olivia-Jade-and-Isabella-Gianulli-Dreading-Holidays-Amid-Mom-Lori-Loughlin-Legal-Battle-01.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Celebs-With-the-Most-Outrageous-Demands-in-Hollywood-Promo.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/beyonce-dramatic-delivery.jpg?resize=120%2C68"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/beyonce-dramatic-delivery.jpg?resize=750%2C540", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Heintz"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/beyonce-jay-z-twins-difficult-delivery-135164/", "title": "Beyonce\u0301 and JAY-Z Had a Drama-Filled Delivery During the Birth of Their Twins!
