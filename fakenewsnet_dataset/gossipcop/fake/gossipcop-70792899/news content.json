It's not nice for Meghan as a non-smoker,\" a friend of the couple told the Daily Mail. \"So there's no more hanging out of the window for a quick puff. Harry has quit for Meghan.\"\n\nRelated: The Surprising Place Where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Will Live\n\nAnd it\u2019s a good thing she stepped in to help Harry quit, because smoking inside their home at Kensington Palace is actually banned. As a royal staff member told the Daily Mail, \u201cRoyal Household sites have been smoke free premises since November 21, 2016.\u201d This includes Kensington, Buckingham, Windsor Castle, St James\u2019s Palace, and all other homes of the royal family.\n\nHowever, Harry wasn\u2019t the only royal affected by the smoking ban and in need of a cigarette intervention.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, Harry\u2019s stepmother Camilla once had a 10 cigarette a day habit, which Prince Charles reportedly hated. Thankfully, she too quit smoking after visiting an alternative health practitioner 15 years ago and has since remained smoke-free.\n\nLuckily for Markle, all this seems to point to the fact that her royal wedding, which will take place in May at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle, will be a smoke-free and relatively healthy affair. Hey, they will be indulging in a lot of fancy wedding cake, after all.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https://cdn-image.travelandleisure.com/sites/default/files/where-to-go-israel-tout-touts0319.jpg&w=300&q=85", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https://cdn-image.travelandleisure.com/sites/default/files/styles/1600x1000/public/worlds-best-cruises-tout-touts0319.jpg&w=300&q=85", "https://cdn-image.travelandleisure.com/sites/default/files/1513031868/prince-harry-quit-smoking-for-meghan-SMOKE1217.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https://cdn-image.travelandleisure.com/sites/default/files/styles/1600x1000/public/1516137244/ruaha-national-park-safari-TANZANIA0218.jpg&w=300&q=85", "https://cdn-image.travelandleisure.com/sites/default/files/styles/1600x1000/public/videos/princeharrymeghanmarklesmoking_0.jpg?itok=imlexfpr"], "top_img": "https://cdn-image.travelandleisure.com/sites/default/files/styles/1600x1000/public/videos/princeharrymeghanmarklesmoking_0.jpg?itok=imlexfpr", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Https", "Plus.Google.Com", "Travelandleisure Posts", "Stacey Leasca"], "canonical_link": "https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-tips/celebrity-travel/prince-harry-quit-smoking-for-meghan-markle", "title": "Meghan Markle Helped Prince Harry Kick a Life-threatening Habit (Video)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Travel and Leisure", "news_keywords": "Travel and Leisure", "description": "Meghan Markle's healthy lifestyle is a good influence on her husband-to-be, Prince Harry.", "author": "https://plus.google.com/+travelandleisure/posts", "og": {"title": "Meghan Markle Helped Prince Harry Kick a Life-threatening Habit (Video)", "type": "article", "site_name": "Travel + Leisure", "url": "https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-tips/celebrity-travel/prince-harry-quit-smoking-for-meghan-markle", "description": "Meghan Markle's healthy lifestyle is a good influence on her husband-to-be, Prince Harry.", "image": "https://cdn-image.travelandleisure.com/sites/default/files/styles/1600x1000/public/videos/princeharrymeghanmarklesmoking_0.jpg?itok=imlexfpr"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-tips/celebrity-travel/prince-harry-quit-smoking-for-meghan-markle", "description": "Meghan Markle's healthy lifestyle is a good influence on her husband-to-be, Prince Harry.", "media": "https://cdn-image.travelandleisure.com/sites/default/files/styles/1600x1000/public/videos/princeharrymeghanmarklesmoking_0.jpg?itok=imlexfpr"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "url": "https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-tips/celebrity-travel/prince-harry-quit-smoking-for-meghan-markle", "title": "Meghan Markle helped Prince Harry kick a life-threatening habit", "description": "Meghan Markle's healthy lifestyle is a good influence on her husband-to-be, Prince Harry.", "site": "@TravelLeisure", "image": "https://cdn-image.travelandleisure.com/sites/default/files/styles/1600x1000/public/videos/princeharrymeghanmarklesmoking_0.jpg?itok=imlexfpr"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1186687021348564, "pages": 25440929072}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.travelandleisure.com", "summary": ""}
