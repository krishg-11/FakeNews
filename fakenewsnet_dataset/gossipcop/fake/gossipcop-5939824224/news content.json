The policy, formed under the Obama administration and implemented in 2012 to protect from deportation the nearly 800,000 young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children, will be rescinded in six months.\n\nAfter Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the news, the president said in a written statement: \u201cI do not favor punishing children, most of whom are now adults, for the actions of their parents. But we must also recognize that we are [a] nation of opportunity because we are a nation of laws.\u201d\n\nWhile many are protesting at Trump Tower and in D.C., Los Angeles, Denver, and New York City, sharing their outrage and heartbreak over the announcement, others are expressing their grievances on social media, including former President Obama:\n\n\u201cTo target these young people is wrong \u2013 because they have done nothing wrong. It is self-defeating \u2013 because they want to start new businesses, staff our labs, serve in our military, and otherwise contribute to the country we love,\u201d Obama said in a poignant Facebook post. \u201cAnd it is cruel. What if our kid\u2019s science teacher, or our friendly neighbor turns out to be a Dreamer? Where are we supposed to send her? To a country she doesn\u2019t know or remember, with a language she may not even speak?\u201d\n\nSee below for more of his thoughts, plus reactions from more public figures and celebrities.\n\nTo target hopeful young strivers who grew up here is wrong, because they\u2019ve done nothing wrong.
