In fact, the two have a great relationship.\n\n\"She has developed an increasingly close, warm relationship with [both] the queen and her father-in-law, Prince Charles,\" the insider said. \"She wants to please them and is doing whatever she can to educate herself to make sure she doesn't put a foot wrong.\"\n\nThis news comes after the National Enquirer reported that the \"British monarchy is open to modernizing.\" However, Markle's \"tacky Hollywood-princess style is not what the royal family had in mind.\"\n\nThe tabloid alleged that Markle's diva behavior has gotten under everyone's skin. The unidentified source said that the Queen has \"told Prince Harry to give his bossy bride a 'shape up or else' ultimatum because she's wrecked his credibility.\"\n\nThe insider added that the Queen called Markle to her chambers and reprimanded her about her fashion. Queen Elizabeth reportedly told the new duchess to dress down because she's not starring in a reality TV show but is representing the world's most prestigious family.\n\nThe Queen wants Markle to \"change her ways immediately.\" Due to the said incidents, the Duchess of Sussex reportedly earned the nickname \"Meghan the Menace.\"\n\nSally Osman, the director of royal communication was reportedly the first casualty of Markle's diva behavior. But Gossip Cop said that it was not true. The former \"Suits\" star moved to London last year, but it was only a week ago that Osman and another palace aide resigned. Also, Osman was not fired, she resigned\n\nDespite the report, the Queen and the Duchess of Sussex get along very well. In fact, the monarch has given Markle privileges that Kate Middleton didn't receive. For instance, Her Majesty invited Markle to visit Cheshire using her personal train. Only the senior royals have used the said transportation. In fact, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and Prince Harry haven't used it.\n\nAlso, Queen Elizabeth II invited the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to the Queen's Young Leaders Awards ceremony. A number of royals were invited to the event since it started in 2014, but Middleton had never been to it.", "images": ["https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2019/12/09/celadon-bankrutpcy.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2019/12/09/facing-almost-certain-impeachment-us-president-donald-trump.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/07/06/george-bush.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2019/12/02/kim-jong-un-is-closely-associated-with-the.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2019/12/09/paul-volcker-who-headed-the-us-central-bank.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2019/12/08/the-pound-is-being-supported-by-expectations-boris.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2019/11/22/tesla-chief-executive-elon-musk-stands-front-companys-first-electric-pickup-truck.JPG", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2019/10/23/the-conference-in-china-is-the-latest-in.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/07/20/queen-elizabeth-ii-meghan-markle.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2017/04/04/carter-page.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2011/09/14/158863-land-rovers-defender.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/07/20/queen-elizabeth-ii-meghan-markle.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.ibtimes.com/queen-elizabeth-didnt-blast-meghan-markle-diva-behavior-report-says-2701533", "title": "Queen Elizabeth Didn't Blast Meghan Markle For 'Diva Behavior,' Report Says", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "meghan markle prince harry news, meghan markle prince harry royal wedding, meghan markle prince harry engagement, meghan markle prince harry relationship, meghan markle prince harry proposal, meghan markle prince harry relationship, meghan markle suits", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "International Business Times", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com/queen-elizabeth-didnt-blast-meghan-markle-diva-behavior-report-says-2701533", "title": "Queen Elizabeth Didn't Blast Meghan Markle For 'Diva Behavior,' Report Says", "description": "Queen Elizabeth II didn't blast Meghan Markle for \"diva behavior\" despite reports.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/07/20/queen-elizabeth-ii-meghan-markle.jpg", "secure_url": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/07/20/queen-elizabeth-ii-meghan-markle.jpg", "height": 396, "width": 594, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "Entertainment", "author": "Catherine Armecin", "modified_time": "2018-07-21T01:54:11-04:00", "published_time": "2018-07-21T01:54:11-04:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Queen Elizabeth Didn't Blast Meghan Markle For 'Diva Behavior,' Report Says", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com/queen-elizabeth-didnt-blast-meghan-markle-diva-behavior-report-says-2701533", "description": "Queen Elizabeth II didn't blast Meghan Markle for \"diva behavior\" despite reports.", "image": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/07/20/queen-elizabeth-ii-meghan-markle.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-config": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#000000", "keywords": "meghan markle prince harry news, meghan markle prince harry royal wedding, meghan markle prince harry engagement, meghan markle prince harry relationship, meghan markle prince harry proposal, meghan markle prince harry relationship, meghan markle suits", "author": "Catherine Armecin", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages06.net,aidataconf.com,amp.ibtimes.co.uk,e-amp.newsweek.com,e-sns.newsweek.com,europe.newsweek.com,events.newsweek.com,ibt-dev.co.uk,ibtimes.co.uk,ibtimes.com,idigitaltimes.com,latintimes.com,medicaldaily.com,newsweek.com,player.one,sns.europe.newsweek.com,sns.ibtimes.co.uk,subscription.newsweek.com,www.ibt-dev.co.uk,www.ibtimes.co.uk,www.ibtimes.com", "description": "Queen Elizabeth II didn't blast Meghan Markle for \"diva behavior\" despite reports."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532152451.0, "source": "http://www.ibtimes.com", "summary": ""}
