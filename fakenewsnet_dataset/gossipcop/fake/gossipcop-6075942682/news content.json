We like to have fun. We like a lot of the same things,\u201d Jessica Biel has said of her husband, Justin Timberlake. \u201cHe supports everything that I do. And that\u2019s [why] I think she\u2019s such a wonderful partner.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s one decision Justin just can\u2019t support. \u201cJessica wants to wait to have more children,\u201d an insider exclusively tells In Touch, \u201cwhile Justin desperately wants another baby right now.\u201d Before their 2012 wedding, Jessica promised the singer they\u2019d have a big family, the insider says. Then she had their son, Silas, 2, and now the 7th Heaven alum isn\u2019t sure about baby No. 2.\n\n(Photo Credit: Splash)\n\nIt\u2019s caused so much tension in their marriage that Justin, 36, and Jessica, 35, have \u201cbeen seeking therapy,\u201d says the insider. \u201cJustin seems miserable.\u201d Justin feels Jessica went back on her word. Originally, \u201cJessica had planned to raise their kids without nannies and even considered moving out of LA,\u201d says the insider.\n\nBut she experienced some major career boosts: In March 2016, Jessica and her partners opened the popular, kid-friendly eatery Au Fudge in West Hollywood. Nearly a year later, she returned to TV as the star and executive producer of the celebrated USA crime drama The Sinner. Now, says the insider, \u201cJessica feels that there\u2019s no rush [to have more kids]. And Justin feels like Jessica\u2019s changed their plans without notice.\u201d\n\nWork isn\u2019t the only thing stopping Jessica from focusing on expanding the family. Trust has long been an issue in their marriage. In 2014, Justin was spied getting cozy with his backup singer Zenya Ashford at a nightclub in Paris. \u201cJessica worries when Justin travels for work,\u201d says the insider. \u201cWhat wife in her position wouldn\u2019t? She is constantly in fear that other women are throwing themselves at him.\u201d\n\nFriends of the couple are praying the duo can overcome their issues. \u201cJessica and Justin could use time alone to rekindle their love. They could use a vacation,\u201d says the insider. \u201cThey\u2019re both loved by those who know them, and everyone is rooting for their marriage to work. But right now, things don\u2019t look good.\u201d\n\nFor more exclusive celebrity news, pick up the latest issue of In Touch, on newsstands now!", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Felicity-Jones-Pregnant.jpg?crop=0px%2C76px%2C2085px%2C2085px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen-shot-2017-12-12-at-5-17-12-pm.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/90-DF-Jesse-Meester-Reacts-to-Avery-and-Angelas-Tell-All-Feud.jpg?crop=0px%2C39px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/90-Day-Fiance-Star-Nicole-Jimenos-BF-01.jpg?crop=53px%2C39px%2C1906px%2C1080px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/justin-timberlake-jessica-biel-son-silas.jpg?w=1180&h=726&crop=1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/lou-pearlman.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Meghan-King-Edmonds-Ready-to-Date-After-Jim-Edmonds-Divorce.jpg?crop=0px%2C78px%2C2770px%2C1572px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jamie-Otis-Claps-Back-at-Mom-Shaming-Sometimes.jpg?crop=0px%2C294px%2C3857px%2C2183px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen-shot-2017-12-12-at-5-17-12-pm.png?resize=1200%2C630", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/nsync.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/screen-shot-2017-10-20-at-1-59-23-am.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Olivia-Jade-and-Isabella-Gianulli-Dreading-Holidays-Amid-Mom-Lori-Loughlin-Legal-Battle-01.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/meghan-markle-prince-harry-kate-middleton-prince-william-reunite.png?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/princess-beatrice-cancels-engagement-party-amid-prince-andrew-scandal.jpg?crop=0px%2C428px%2C3516px%2C1990px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Celebs-With-the-Most-Outrageous-Demands-in-Hollywood-Promo.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/an-unexpected-killer-larry-swartz-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2550px%2C1444px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Biel-Pushed-Justin-Timberlake-Make-a-Public-Statement-PDA-Scandal-Promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Baby-to-Age-4-See-Baby-Chanel-Nicole-Transformation-Over-the-Years-landing-01.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C2000px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tara-Reid-Transformation-Promo.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jesse-Meester-Tom-Brooks-Bonded-Over-Darcey-Silva-Drama-01.jpg?crop=2px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen-shot-2017-12-12-at-5-17-12-pm.png?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["In Touch Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/justin-timberlake-jessica-biel-fighting-baby-no-2-148876/", "title": "Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel Are Fighting Over Baby No. 2", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "She makes it seem like they have the perfect marriage. \u201cWe believe in loyalty, honesty.
