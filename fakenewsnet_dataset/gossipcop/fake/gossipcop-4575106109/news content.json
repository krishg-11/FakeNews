It\u2019s fairly safe to assume Trump will not be joining Putin on a love seat for for a tell-all with Megyn Kelly anytime soon, as much as we would like to will that into existence.\n\nLauer, Gossip Cop reports, will continue to be the face of Today and a key fixture at NBC News despite the arrival of Kelly, which is currently slated for June.\n\nFrom the report:\n\nThe notion that Lauer has been \u201creplaced,\u201d says an extremely well-placed NBC News insider, is \u201ctotally false.\u201d And as for the contention that there will be a joint Putin and Trump interview, and that it will be conducted by Kelly, our impeccable source calls it \u201claughable.\u201d\n\nIn Touch has published a number of demonstrably false stories touting a feud between Lauer and Kelly, including another cover story from February alleging Lauer was going to be \u201cdumped\u201d at the Today show in favor of the former Fox News star.\n\nLast September, when she was still at Fox, Kelly\u2013\u2013who said she\u2019s friends with Lauer and respects him a lot\u2013\u2013defended him after he got criticism in the liberal media for not being tough enough on Donald Trump during that NBC News presidential forum.\n\nHave a tip we should know?
