It was the most intimate conversation Brad and Jen have ever had.\"\n\nActor Jennifer Aniston (L) and Justin Theroux attend Jason Bateman's star unveiling ceremony on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, on July 26, 2017, in Hollywood, California. / AFP PHOTO / VALERIE MACONVALERIE MACON/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\"He apologised to Jen for being an absentee husband, for being stoned and bored. He also made amends for leaving her for Angelina,\" the source said.\n\nAniston wed actor and screenwriter Justin Theroux in 2015.\n\nActor Brad Pitt (L) and actress Angelina Jolie arrive at the 84th Annual Academy Awards held at the Hollywood & Highland Center on February 26, 2012 in Hollywood, California.

I was boozing too much. It\u2019s just become a problem.\n\n\"And I\u2019m really happy, it\u2019s been half a year now, which is bittersweet, but I\u2019ve got my feelings in my fingertips again.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I enjoy wine very, very much, but I just ran it to the ground. I had to step away for a minute. And truthfully I could drink a Russian under the table with his own vodka. I was a professional. I was good.\"\n\nPitt, who has six children with Jolie, admitted that he had \"hit the lottery\" but let it go to waste, and is now finding comfort in therapy.\n\nHe said: \"I just started therapy. I love it, I love it. I went through two therapists to get to the right one.\"\n\nHe added: \"For me this period has really been about looking at my weaknesses and failures and owning my side of the street. I\u2019m an asshole when it comes to this need for justice \u2026 It\u2019s such a silly idea, the idea that the world is fair.\n\n\"And this is coming from a guy who hit the lottery, I\u2019m well aware of that. I hit the lottery, and I still would waste my time on those hollow pursuits.\"\n\nAfter Angelina filed for divorce, Brad could not even bear to be in their house in the Hollywood Hills, saying: \"It was too sad to be here at first, so I went and stayed on a friend\u2019s floor, a little bungalow in Santa Monica.\n\n\u201cI crashed over here a little bit, my friend (David) Fincher lives right here. He\u2019s always going to have an open door for me, and I was doing a lot of stuff on the Westside, so I stayed at my friend\u2019s house on the floor for a month and a half.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if the split was like grieving a death, Pitt replied: \u201cYeah,\u201d before adding that it has made him want to be a better father.\n\nHe said: \"It\u2019s hit me smack in the face with our divorce: I gotta be more. I gotta be more for them. I have to show them. And I haven\u2019t been great at it.\"\n\nPitt faced an FBI probe into an alleged altercation between him and his 15-year-old adopted son Maddox on a private plane, which happened just days before Jolie filed for divorce in September.\n\nThe investigation was closed in November, with Pitt facing no charges over the incident.\n\nOnline Editors", "images":
