{"url": "www.amazon.com/Lion-Dev-Patel/dp/B01MT3LMT4", "text": "My 10 year old daughter wanted to watch this film - she read the Junior Novelization and was so looking forward to it, I bought it and watched it with her. I knew ahead of time there were mature themes - and to do justice to the story, they had to be there. My daughter is very sheltered - and so I was glad I watched it with her - as it gave us a lot of talking points about hard issues she's not normally exposed to in her everyday life. It was nice to see a movie focused on adoption to actually talk about post-adoption issues like trauma, etc. - and not gloss over those. Nicole Kidman did a beautiful job - all the actors did. I understand why this was nominated for so many Oscars. Ultimately, I'm glad I watched it with my daughter - even though there were some uncomfortable moments in the film with regards to implied sex, child endangerment, etc. I think it made my daughter appreciate her comfortable life much more - and to be thankful for all that she has. After the movie ended, she started cleaning the kitchen - which she never does!! Ha! Sometimes it's good for kids to stretch themselves and be exposed to films that show a life that's different from theirs. It also made her want to help with the orphan foundation started by the film - (listed in the end credits) - she was very shocked that 80,000 children become orphaned every year in India. This film opened her eyes (mine, too) - and was simply gorgeous...well worth the price paid to own it.", "images": ["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91vMemHo8CL._SX150_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Fhplcu5tL._SX150_.jpg", "http://www.amazon.com/Lion-Dev-Patel/dp/B01MT3LMT4/uedata/unsticky/147-9814801-8374456/Video/ntpoffrw?noscript&id=SZ9NPHQYW4NAH73Z50AH&pty=Detail&spty=Movie&pti=B01MT3LMT4", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/US-hq/2019/img/Events/XCM_Manual_400x39_1193499XCM_Manual_1193499_us_events_swm_1__1572962174_jpg._CB447999735_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/463f4dfa-96d7-4c57-a0d7-7a0120e5486d._CR65,0,370,370_SX48_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815yjqwC-NL._SX150_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1zLuk5QXTL._SX150_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/63e38fad-0a7d-41c7-901b-918c4dbed42e._CR62,0,375,375_SX48_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81CSudJmdbL._SX150_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81wwzswEYLL._SX300_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812Wq7yqVoL._SX150_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91pcbAyWHJL._SX150_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1j54D2jpxL._SX150_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91LpR44Tk+L._SX150_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91zPCrqeS4L._SX150_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81MuVDGcV1L._SX150_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-LbAg5+dL._SX150_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91z-DrH0NvL._SX150_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/8efd3f44-4bfd-4f7a-9487-f7a42d61c4ca._CR0,0,442,442_SX48_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/811W7NiLnWL._SX150_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81DBAsROwyL._SX150_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WD4UZMGkL._SX150_.jpg", "http://fls-na.amazon.com/1/batch/1/OP/ATVPDKIKX0DER:147-9814801-8374456:SZ9NPHQYW4NAH73Z50AH$uedata=s:%2FLion-Dev-Patel%2Fdp%2FB01MT3LMT4%2Fuedata%2Funsticky%2F147-9814801-8374456%2FVideo%2Fntpoffrw%3Fnoscript%26id%3DSZ9NPHQYW4NAH73Z50AH%26pty%3DDetail%26spty%3DMovie%26pti%3DB01MT3LMT4:2000", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-LvNONnYL._SX150_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/7adacc73-2a12-4bb0-b5fa-3b3a281bb5f1._CR62,0,375,375_SX48_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91VXNxm9P9L._SX150_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813sYyr-W6L._SX150_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1+hmToFNeL._SX150_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/gno/sprites/nav-sprite-global_bluebeacon-1x_optimized_layout1._CB468670774_.png", "http://fls-na.amazon.com/1/batch/1/OP/ATVPDKIKX0DER:147-9814801-8374456:SZ9NPHQYW4NAH73Z50AH$uedata=s:%2FLion-Dev-Patel%2Fdp%2FB01MT3LMT4%2Fuedata%2Funsticky%2F147-9814801-8374456%2FVideo%2Fntpoffrw%3Fstaticb%26id%3DSZ9NPHQYW4NAH73Z50AH%26pty%3DDetail%26spty%3DTVSeason%26pti%3DB00D6BRF5I:1000", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/94b04703-db55-48d2-a0d5-32a3adfa88cd._CR174,0,1530,1530_SX48_.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81wwzswEYLL._SX300_.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.amazon.com/Lion-Dev-Patel/dp/B01NANP98N", "title": "Prime Video", "meta_data": {"description": "A 5 yr old boy gets lost on the streets of Calcutta, thousands of kilometers from home.
