It was something that she had been thinking about for a long time and she wanted her body to heal after the surgery given the risks of complications,\u201d a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\nThe 67-year-old even kept the news of the procedure from her own family members! \u201cFor her it was the final stage to becoming a woman and she did not really discuss it with her immediate family.

Which is why this is the first time, and the last time, I will ever speak of it.\u201d While she doesn\u2019t go into in-depth detail, the former Olympian says that having a penis had \u201cno special gifts or use for me\u2026I just want to have all the right parts. I am also tired of tucking the damn thing in all the time.\u201d\n\nShe had the surgery in Jan. 2017 and decided to share the news \u201cso all of you can stop staring,\u201d and says that she feels \u201cnot only wonderful but liberated.
