She actually surprised me one day at a meeting. She walked in and said, \u2018Guess what we\u2019re going to do!\u2019 It\u2019s a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nA perennial multi-tasker, the producer and manager is also collaborating with professional networking platform Bumble Bizz to find a new personal assistant.\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

And I love that about her. She\u2019s really so impressive. And she\u2019s such a good mom. She\u2019s so dedicated to her baby.\u201d\n\nContinues Jenner: \u201cWe were at the Met Ball and all she could focus on when we were done was getting home. She\u2019s like, \u2018Come on we\u2019ve got to go see Stormi! It was really sweet to see her anxious to get home to Stormi.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Kris Jenner Opens Up About Future Family Gatherings with Babies Stormi, True and Chicago\n\nImage zoom Kylie Jenner and daughter Stormi Kylie Jenner/Instagram\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Born Kardashian \u2013 Kylie Jenner\u2019s Pregnancy\n\nThe youngest Jenner even took over the hosting reins. \u201cAt Easter, Kylie had a newborn and that\u2019s a major time when you have a first baby and you\u2019re that young and you\u2019re trying to figure it all out,\u201d says Jenner. \u201cAnd she hosted the family\u2019s Easter which is not an easy task! She had this elaborate gorgeous party that she wanted to do for all of us just out of love because she wanted to make sure that we had this amazing morning after church. She\u2019s always doing things like that.\u201d\n\nAnd Jenner, who became a first-time mom to daughter Kourtney at age 22, says she sees glimpses of herself in her youngest child.\n\n\u201cI do see myself in Kylie,\u201d says Jenner. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t stopped! And she does remind me of me in that way. I\u2019m so proud of her.
