I don\u2019t even recognise it. It\u2019s also scary to know that climate change is due to human activity, and we continue to ignore it, and the only voice that we really have is through voting.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you have voted very recently, as a country\u201d the reporter noted \u2013 to which Lawrence replied that \u201cit was really startling\u201d Mr Trump was elected.\n\nShe then suggested the recent hurricanes devastating Texas and nearing Florida may have been prompted by Mr Trump winning the presidency.\n\n\u201cYou know, you\u2019re watching these hurricanes now, and it\u2019s really hard, especially while promoting this movie, not to feel Mother Nature\u2019s rage and wrath,\u201d Lawrence said.\n\nLawrence later said the conversation topics of Mr Trump and US politics were \u201creally polarising and upsetting.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve heard things and seen things on TV in my own country that devastate me and make me sick, and it\u2019s just really confusing,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter being asked whether she finds Mr Trump confusing, the actress fired back, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t find him confusing. I think I know exactly what he is.\u201d\n\nLawrence has never been shy about sharing her opinions on the President.\n\nIn 2015, when Trump had just launched his presidential campaign, she said a victory by him would \u201cbe the end of the world,\u201d during an Entertainment Weekly interview.\n\nSocial media users were quick to hit out at the star for politicising a natural disaster.\n\nWhat a dumbass!! Typical Hollywood snowflake. Should stick to memorizing lines and not using brain. #JenniferLawrence #MAGA \u2014 George Branton (@GeorgeBranton) September 8, 2017\n\nOpens twitter\n\nReads, \"Jennifer Lawrence said hurricanes are punishment for voting for Trump.\"\n\nCloses Twitter\n\nNever watches her movies again \u2014 Nate Inman (@StreetsofCberry) September 8, 2017\n\nHollywood's ..Jennifer Lawrence has stated this Hurricane season is because we voted for Trump ..
