On auditioning for entirely different roles post-Twilight, Pattinson said, \u201cIt\u2019s not like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll come down from an ivory tower to be\u2026\u2019 I mean, these movies are hard for me to get. Literally, I\u2019m just as much trying to convince people, like, every single time. And it\u2019s not like I\u2019m, like, Leo [ DiCaprio ] or something!\u201d\n\nIn the interview, it was revealed Good Time producers Josh and Benny Safdie were initially hesitant to work with Pattinson, but later discovered their opinions on the actor were far from accurate. On breaking free from his once perceived image as a teen heartthrob, the star said, \u201cI think so much of life people are trying to put you in a box and define you all the time.\u201d He continued, \u201cIt\u2019s just exciting to have a job where you\u2019re allowed to consistently break the walls of the box around you.\u201d\n\nPattinson went on to talk about the vast amount of media attention he\u2019s received since taking on the role of a lifetime in the Twilight series, despite his best-efforts to keep his personal life under wraps. \u201cI\u2019m quite an open person,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be one of those people who\u2019s just like, \u2018Oh, no comment,\u2019 \u2019cause I just think you just look like an idiot if you\u2019re in it. But then the annoying thing happens as well, then you answer in these kind of vague ways which kind of create these weird conspiracy theorists.\u201d\n\nThe star added, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to deal with it. And so I thought in a way to kind of stop feeding it, you just try and say \u2018I don\u2019t wanna talk about it.\u2019 And also, it kind of makes you feel like that\u2019s the only way you can get some kind of strength.\u201d Watch Pattinson\u2019s full interview below!", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=270798540384083&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6036262&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/3d87b979-b07b-4349-894d-492d922dea2c", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wOC8wOS81OThiNmMwNjQ0YTY0YjdmYjllYjU5NDMvNTk4YjZjMDYwYzJhZmYxOWEwMDhhNDQ1X29fRl92MC5qcGc=", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/b35b5b4491f134f1e0a1732cbb30842a?ops=gravity(%22center%22),maxcontain(96,60)", "http://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/57d1caf936ce620b3fa9e66f", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/b35b5b4491f134f1e0a1732cbb30842a?ops=gravity(%22center%22),maxcontain(158,100),quality(90)"], "top_img": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wOC8wOS81OThiNmMwNjQ0YTY0YjdmYjllYjU5NDMvNTk4YjZjMDYwYzJhZmYxOWEwMDhhNDQ1X29fRl92MC5qcGc=", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Holly Nicol"], "canonical_link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-08-20-robert-pattinson-on-movie-roles-people-are-trying-to-put-you-in-a-box/", "title": "Robert Pattinson On Movie Roles: 'People Are Trying To Put You In A Box'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "He admitted to opting for more independent movies after he shot to superstardom after \"Twilight\" success.", "thumbnail": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wOC8wOS81OThiNmMwNjQ0YTY0YjdmYjllYjU5NDMvNTk4YjZjMDYwYzJhZmYxOWEwMDhhNDQ1X29fRl92MC5qcGc=", "keywords": "Robert Pattinson On Movie Roles: 'People Are Trying To Put You In A Box'", "og": {"title": "Robert Pattinson On Movie Roles: 'People Are Trying To Put You In A Box' | 98.7 Country WOVK", "type": "article", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wOC8wOS81OThiNmMwNjQ0YTY0YjdmYjllYjU5NDMvNTk4YjZjMDYwYzJhZmYxOWEwMDhhNDQ1X29fRl92MC5qcGc=", "url": "https://wovk.iheart.com/content/2017-08-20-robert-pattinson-on-movie-roles-people-are-trying-to-put-you-in-a-box/", "description": "He admitted to opting for more independent movies after he shot to superstardom after \"Twilight\" success.", "site_name": "98.7 Country WOVK", "locale": "en_US"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://wovk.iheart.com/content/2017-08-20-robert-pattinson-on-movie-roles-people-are-trying-to-put-you-in-a-box/", "site": "@987countrywovk", "creator": "@987countrywovk", "description": "He admitted to opting for more independent movies after he shot to superstardom after \"Twilight\" success.", "title": "Robert Pattinson On Movie Roles: 'People Are Trying To Put You In A Box' | 98.7 Country WOVK", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wOC8wOS81OThiNmMwNjQ0YTY0YjdmYjllYjU5NDMvNTk4YjZjMDYwYzJhZmYxOWEwMDhhNDQ1X29fRl92MC5qcGc=", "domain": "wovk.iheart.com"}, "parsely-title": "Robert Pattinson On Movie Roles: 'People Are Trying To Put You In A Box' | 98.7 Country WOVK", "parsely-link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-08-20-robert-pattinson-on-movie-roles-people-are-trying-to-put-you-in-a-box/", "parsely-image-url": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wOC8wOS81OThiNmMwNjQ0YTY0YjdmYjllYjU5NDMvNTk4YjZjMDYwYzJhZmYxOWEwMDhhNDQ1X29fRl92MC5qcGc=", "parsely-tags": "Robert Pattinson On Movie Roles: 'People Are Trying To Put You In A Box'", "parsely-type": "post", "application-name": "98.7 Country WOVK", "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wOC8wOS81OThiNmMwNjQ0YTY0YjdmYjllYjU5NDMvNTk4YjZjMDYwYzJhZmYxOWEwMDhhNDQ1X29fRl92MC5qcGc=", "google-site-verification": "p2FWrUKxtwBmQgHV4CjD80oKdZZBjmMNByoWvZMsYso", "msvalidate.01": "E98E323249F89ACF6294F958692E230B", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-08-20 12:23:00-04:00", "parsely-author": "Holly Nicol", "parsely-section": "entertainment-news-national-gossip-celeb-etc"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503201600.0, "source": "http://wovk.iheart.com", "summary": ""}
