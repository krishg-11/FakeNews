A palace insider EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com all about their feud!\n\nThis is more royal drama than an episode of The Crown! Meghan Markle, 36, is extremely despondent over her half-sister Samantha\u2018s plans to write a \u201ctell-all\u201d book about the soon-to-be princess, according to a source inside the palace who gave us the EXCLUSIVE deets. \u201cMeghan and Harry will not be responding to Samantha\u2019s comments, as they have no intention of adding fuel to the fire, or giving her anymore publicity,\u201d our source said. \u201cMeghan is really sad that her half-sister is trying to cash in on her relationship with Harry, but she realizes that it was fairly inevitable. Samantha has been telling people that her upcoming memoir is going to contain \u2018explosive\u2019 information about Meghan, that will \u2018shock\u2019 the royal family to the core \u2014 which is utter nonsense.\u201d\n\nOur palace insider went on to say that Samantha has no secrets about Meghan \u2014 because Meghan has absolutely nothing to hide. \u201cThere are no secrets about Meghan that can be revealed,\u201d our source added. \u201cShe\u2019s been completely transparent about her past and has no skeletons in the closet, so unless Samantha intends to make things up, her book is going to make for pretty dull reading.\u201d Well, it would seem the bad blood between Meghan and her family goes both ways. We reported earlier how Meghan\u2019s father Thomas Markle Sr., 73, was apparently \u201cextremely hurt\u201d by Prince Harry\u2018s remarks that the royals will become the family Meghan never had.\n\nIn addition to her plans to write a book about Meghan, Samantha recently slammed Harry for his remarks about her family. While you wonder if Samantha and Thomas will be invited to the wedding, click here to see pics of celebs, including Meghan and Harry, who had the cutest engagements of 2017.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Meghan and her half-sister will reconcile in 2018?
