Detroit also would receive forward Brice Johnson and center Willie Reed.\n\nThe All-Star forward could be looking at a long distance relationship with girlfriend and model Kendall Jenner, sister of Kim and Khloe Kardashian.\n\nRELATED: Blake Griffin Trade Gets Social Media Talking, And He Even Gets In A Classic Comment\n\nBetween the Kardashians\u2019 reality show and paparazzi buzzing around, could there really be a Kardashian curse?\n\nKim and Khloe both married and divorced NBA players who saw better days on the court before marrying into the family, thrusting their lives into the spotlight.\n\nFan favorite Lamar Odom was traded from the Lakers to the Dallas Mavericks in 2011. His career then went downhill and then he almost died of a drug overdose while married to Khloe.\n\nKim was married to New Jersey Nets player Kris Humphries for just 72 days. He has played for four different NBA teams since the well-documented brief marriage.", "images": ["https://denver.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2017/10/losangeles.png", "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2018/06/3_losangeles_cbs2_kcal9.png?w=320", "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2018/01/gettyimages-909944070.jpg?w=1500", "https://i1.wp.com/losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2019/12/baby-Jesus-cage.jpg?resize=55%2C55&ssl=1", "https://i1.wp.com/losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2019/12/Carjacking-1.jpg?resize=55%2C55&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2019/12/Cudahy-Homicide-1.jpg?resize=55%2C55&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2019/12/Kevin-Clements.jpg?resize=55%2C55&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2010/10/la-animal-services.jpg?resize=55%2C55&ssl=1", "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/themes/cbs-local/plugins/modules/theme-manager/images/cbs-local-logo-white.png", "https://i1.wp.com/losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2019/12/Missing-woman.jpg?resize=55%2C55&ssl=1", "https://i1.wp.com/losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2019/12/77C08F9024B04B3B88C9B734EA746848.jpg?resize=55%2C55&ssl=1", "https://i1.wp.com/losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2019/03/gettyimages-1130118403-1.jpg?resize=55%2C55&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2019/12/salad.jpg?resize=55%2C55&ssl=1", "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2019/09/30h-LA-white-horizontal.png?w=408", "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/themes/cbs-local/images/global/blank_1x1.gif"], "top_img": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2018/01/gettyimages-909944070.jpg?w=1500", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2018/01/29/blake-griffin-kardashian-curse/", "title": "Is Blake Griffin Part Of A Kardashian Curse?", "meta_data": {"news_keywords": "kendall jenner, kardashian curse, blake griffin trade, nba players and the kardashians", "keywords": "kendall jenner, kardashian curse, blake griffin trade, nba players and the kardashians", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "fb": {"pages": 57972945858}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.4", "og": {"title": "Is Blake Griffin Part Of A Kardashian Curse?", "image": {"identifier": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2018/01/gettyimages-909944070.jpg?w=1500", "secure_url": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2018/01/gettyimages-909944070.jpg?w=1500", "width": 1500, "height": 1000}, "description": "The All-Star forward could be looking at a long distance relationship with girlfriend and model Kendall Jenner, sister of Kim and Khloe Kardashian.", "type": "article", "url": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2018/01/29/blake-griffin-kardashian-curse/"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-29T23:22:20+00:00", "suggested-social-copy": "The All-Star forward could be looking at a long distance relationship with girlfriend and model Kendall Jenner, sister of Kim and Khloe Kardashian.", "publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSLA", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSLA"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2018/01/gettyimages-909944070.jpg?w=1500", "title": "Is Blake Griffin Part Of A Kardashian Curse?", "description": "The All-Star forward could be looking at a long distance relationship with girlfriend and model Kendall Jenner, sister of Kim and Khloe Kardashian.", "site": "CBSLA"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2019/06/cropped-la-favicon-512.png?w=270", "description": "The All-Star forward could be looking at a long distance relationship with girlfriend and model Kendall Jenner, sister of Kim and Khloe Kardashian."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517202000.0, "source": "http://losangeles.cbslocal.com", "summary": ""}
