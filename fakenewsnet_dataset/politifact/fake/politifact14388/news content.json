One sentence in a NYC couple\u2019s suicide note tells the story of how so many Americans are feeling about health care these days. With premiums skyrocketing, it\u2019s difficult to pay for healthcare even if you don\u2019t have \u201cmedical issues\u201d like this couple did. This is tragic and is symbolic of the desperation so many people are feeling right now.\n\nA Manhattan couple committed suicide just a few hours after Senate Republicans tried to pass a bill that would repeal Obamacare.\n\nBut three members of their own party \u2013 including Sen. John McCain \u2013 voted against the bill and it failed to pass, keeping the Affordable Care Act in place for now.\n\nThe couple jumped out of a window of a New York City office building together in desperation over their inability to afford their health care: \u2018We both have medical issues, we just can\u2019t afford the health care.\u2019\n\nThe incident happened early Friday morning on the corner of Madison Avenue and 33rd Street \u2013 just a block from the Empire State Building.\n\nA 53-year-old chiropractor and his 50-year-old wife jumped out of a window of their recently-closed ninth-floor office in the 17-story building.\n\nTheir bodies were covered with white sheets once police arrived at the scene, shutting down the entire block to investigate.\n\nThe couple left behind suicide notes in a ziploc bag, that also included their IDs. Police have not released their names yet, but a photo obtained by the New York Post shows part of the letter, and it identifies the woman as Patricia. The note was titled \u2018We had a wonderful life\u2019. A law enforcement source who spoke with the Post said the woman\u2019s note said: \u2018Our kids are upstairs, please take care of them\u2019.\n\n\n\nThe man left one behind too, which read: \u2018We both have medical issues, we just can\u2019t afford the health care.\u2019\n\nThe building that the couple jumped from includes offices for law and advertising firms, therapists offices and commercial space.\n\nNo further information on the couple has been released. It\u2019s unclear how many children they left behind.\n\nPerry Kim, 49, a worker at Pure Green, a juice shop on the same block, said that he was outside just after 5:30am this morning when he heard an \u2018ahhh\u2019 noise and saw two people fall from the top of the building.\n\nThe man appeared to hit his head and the woman had suffered abdominal injuries. They landed face up to the sky.\n\nComments", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170808064733im_/https://i1.wp.com/newsbreakshere.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/UCScreenshot20170808100344.png?resize=310%2C165&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170808064733im_/https://i1.wp.com/newsbreakshere.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/UCScreenshot20170731093801.png?resize=478%2C251&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170808064733im_/https://i0.wp.com/newsbreakshere.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/UCScreenshot20170808095518.png?resize=310%2C165&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170808064733im_/https://i2.wp.com/newsbreakshere.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/UCScreenshot20170808095614.png?resize=310%2C165&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170808064733im_/https://i1.wp.com/2ps46p2qeea548gs4x33cbdz.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/072817suicide17sg-1-2.jpg?resize=607%2C690", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170808064733im_/https://i2.wp.com/newsbreakshere.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/UCScreenshot20170808100028.png?resize=310%2C165&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170808064733im_/https://i1.wp.com/newsbreakshere.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/UCScreenshot20170731093801.png?resize=478%2C251&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170808064733/https://newsbreakshere.com/nyc-physician-wife-jump-deathleave-kids-behind-cant-afford-health-care-hours-mccain-murkowski-collins-every-democrat-voted", "title": "NYC: PHYSICIAN and Wife Jump To Death\u2026Leave Kids Behind Because They \u201cCan\u2019t Afford The Health Care\u201d Only Hours After McCain, Murkowski, Collins and EVERY Democrat Voted To Keep Obamacare -", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "NYC: PHYSICIAN and Wife Jump To Death\u2026Leave Kids Behind Because They \u201cCan\u2019t Afford The Health Care\u201d Only Hours After McCain, Murkowski, Collins and EVERY Democrat Voted To Keep Obamacare -", "type": "article", "description": "Health Care.
