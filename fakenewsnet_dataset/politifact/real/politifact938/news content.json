Mr. Gibbs said they would put in place a \u201cstricter regulatory structure\u201d to prevent breakdowns in food-safety inspections.\n\nPart of the review is sure to examine whether the requirement for the peanut company\u2019s approval caused delays in warnings about its products once public health officials became aware of significant problems at its plant in Blakely, Ga. The warning also covered products from the company\u2019s customers that manufacture food, including Kellogg.\n\nA representative for the peanut company would not comment. Kris Charles, a Kellogg spokeswoman, said \u201cKellogg acted quickly and recalled potentially impacted products within hours\u201d of the peanut company\u2019s second recall announcement.\n\nJudy Leon, an F.D.A. spokeswoman, refused to comment.\n\nMore than 500 people have been sick in the outbreak of salmonella poisoning, and 8 have died. More than 430 product brands have been recalled.\n\nThe delays meant Sarah Kirchner of Belle Plaine, Minn., whose two young children became ill from the outbreak, for weeks had no idea how to prevent a recurrence. Her 3-year-old son, Michael, was hospitalized for four days with intense pain in his head, neck and shoulders, she said.\n\n\u201cHe had a spinal tap, bone scan, M.R.I. and a CT scan,\u201d Ms. Kirchner said. \u201cI\u2019m still so worried about him.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It\u2019s just unbelievable,\u201d said Ms. DeLauro, who promised to offer legislation on Wednesday that would split the agency\u2019s food oversight into a separate entity with mandatory recall authority and other powers.\n\nPublic health officials pinpointed the Blakely plant as the source of the salmonella outbreak on Jan. 9. The peanut company announced a limited recall on Jan. 13 and expanded it on Jan. 16. The company waited until Jan. 28 before recalling all products made at the plant in 2007 and 2008, even though it had known since 2007 that tests of products showed contamination with salmonella.\n\nFood buyers and some top public health officials say they knew before any public announcement that the company\u2019s products and those of its customers were the likeliest source of the outbreak.\n\nCraig Wilson, an assistant vice president at Costco, said he pulled Kellogg\u2019s Keebler and Austin peanut butter crackers off shelves a day before Kellogg\u2019s first announcement and nearly a week before the Peanut company and Kellogg issued a nationwide recall that covered those cookies.\n\nMr. Wilson said he could not wait for the F.D.A. to make announcements about food problems that are widely known among food safety officials.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say that you can\u2019t rely on the F.D.A.,\u201d Mr. Wilson said, \u201cbut we certainly can move quicker than they do.\u201d\n\nThe F.D.A. can seize a product that it suspects is contaminated, and it can ask a federal judge for authority to recall products if a maker refuses to do so. The agency can also announce that it suspects problems with a product before the company agrees to a recall. But it rarely does any of these.\n\nBill Marler, a food safety lawyer in Seattle, said the agency had neither the authority nor the courage it needed to keep the food supply safe.\n\nMichael R. Taylor, a former top official at the food agency, said change was needed.\n\n\u201cF.D.A. negotiates communications about recalls with companies,\u201d Mr. Taylor said, \u201cand that sometimes leads to delays. Changing that dynamic when people are getting seriously ill and dying is something that ought to happen.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gardiner Harris"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/03/health/policy/03peanut.html", "title": "Peanut Product Recall Took Company Approval", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "applicationName": "article", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/1231546923693", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/03/health/policy/03peanut.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/03/health/policy/03peanut.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/1231546923693"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/03/health/policy/03peanut.html", "title": "Peanut Product Recall Took Company Approval", "description": "Federal health officials needed the Peanut Corporation of America\u2019s permission before announcing a recall of its products, which may have delayed contamination warnings.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary", "creator": "gardinerharris"}, "robots": "noarchive", "hdl_p": "Peanut Product Recall Took Company Approval", "description": "Federal health officials needed the Peanut Corporation of America\u2019s permission before announcing a recall of its products, which may have delayed contamination warnings.", "genre": "News", "articleid": 1231546923693, "usageTerms": "https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893968-Terms-of-sale", "hdl": "Peanut Product Recall Took Company Approval", "pdate": 20090202, "utime": 20141125053757, "ptime": 20090202225731, "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 2, 2009", "dat": "Feb. 2, 2009", "lp": "Federal health officials needed the Peanut Corporation of America\u2019s permission before announcing a recall of its products, which may have delayed contamination warnings.", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "cre": "The New York Times", "slug": "03peanut", "article": {"collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/policy/index.jsonp", "published": "2009-02-02T22:57:31-05:00", "modified": "2014-11-25T05:37:57-05:00", "section": "Money & Policy", "section-taxonomy-id": "7D6BE1AF-8CD8-430B-8B2A-17CD0EAA99AC", "top-level-section": "health", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/gardiner-harris", "tag": "Food Contamination and Poisoning"}, "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/policy/index.jsonp", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/03/health/policy/03peanut.html", "type": "article", "title": "Peanut Product Recall Took Company Approval", "description": "Federal health officials needed the Peanut Corporation of America\u2019s permission before announcing a recall of its products, which may have delayed contamination warnings.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png"}, "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170, "pages": 993603507345855}, "author": "Gardiner Harris", "tone": "feature", "byl": "By GARDINER HARRIS", "PT": "article", "CG": "health", "SCG": "policy", "PST": "News", "tom": "News", "edt": "NewYork", "des": "Food Contamination and Poisoning", "org": "Peanut Corporation of America", "keywords": "Salmonella (Bacteria),Peanuts,Recalls and Bans of Products,Peanut Corporation of America,Bacteria,Food Contamination and Poisoning", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "health/policy", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1233637200.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
