Whenever there\u2019s something the G.O.P. doesn\u2019t like \u2014 say, environmental protection \u2014 Heritage can be counted on to produce a report, based on no economic model anyone else recognizes, claiming that this policy would cause huge job losses. Correspondingly, whenever there\u2019s something Republicans want, like tax cuts for the wealthy or for corporations, Heritage can be counted on to claim that this policy would yield immense economic benefits.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe point is that the two parties don\u2019t just live in different moral universes, they also live in different intellectual universes, with Republicans in particular having a stable of supposed experts who reliably endorse whatever they propose.\n\nSo when pundits call on the parties to sit down together and talk, the obvious question is, what are they supposed to talk about? Where\u2019s the common ground?\n\nEventually, of course, America must choose between these differing visions. And we have a way of doing that. It\u2019s called democracy.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

But last year the G.O.P. ran against what it called the \u201cmassive Medicare cuts\u201d contained in the health reform law. How, then, can the election have provided a mandate for a plan that not only would preserve all of those cuts, but would go on, over time, to dismantle Medicare completely?\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, polls suggest that the public\u2019s priorities are nothing like those embodied in the Republican budget. Large majorities support higher, not lower, taxes on the wealthy. Large majorities \u2014 including a majority of Republicans \u2014 also oppose major changes to Medicare. Of course, the poll that matters is the one on Election Day. But that\u2019s all the more reason to make the 2012 election a clear choice between visions.\n\nWhich brings me to those calls for a bipartisan solution. Sorry to be cynical, but right now \u201cbipartisan\u201d is usually code for assembling some conservative Democrats and ultraconservative Republicans \u2014 all of them with close ties to the wealthy, and many who are wealthy themselves \u2014 and having them proclaim that low taxes on high incomes and drastic cuts in social insurance are the only possible solution.\n\nThis would be a corrupt, undemocratic way to make decisions about the shape of our society even if those involved really were wise men with a deep grasp of the issues. It\u2019s much worse when many of those at the table are the sort of people who solicit and believe the kind of policy analyses that the Heritage Foundation supplies.\n\nSo let\u2019s not be civil. Instead, let\u2019s have a frank discussion of our differences. In particular, if Democrats believe that Republicans are talking cruel nonsense, they should say so \u2014 and take their case to the voters.", "images":
