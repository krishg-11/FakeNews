Instead, the argument against helping the unemployed is framed in terms of economic risks: Do anything to create jobs and interest rates will soar, runaway inflation will break out, and so on. But these risks keep not materializing. Interest rates remain near historic lows, while inflation outside the price of oil \u2014 which is determined by world markets and events, not U.S. policy \u2014 remains low.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd against these hypothetical risks one must set the reality of an economy that remains deeply depressed, at great cost both to today\u2019s workers and to our nation\u2019s future. After all, how can we expect to prosper two decades from now when millions of young graduates are, in effect, being denied the chance to get started on their careers?\n\nAsk for a coherent theory behind the abandonment of the unemployed and you won\u2019t get an answer. Instead, members of the Pain Caucus seem to be making it up as they go along, inventing ever-changing rationales for their never-changing policy prescriptions .\n\nWhile the ostensible reasons for inflicting pain keep changing, however, the policy prescriptions of the Pain Caucus all have one thing in common: They protect the interests of creditors, no matter the cost. Deficit spending could put the unemployed to work \u2014 but it might hurt the interests of existing bondholders. More aggressive action by the Fed could help boost us out of this slump \u2014 in fact, even Republican economists have argued that a bit of inflation might be exactly what the doctor ordered \u2014 but deflation , not inflation, serves the interests of creditors. And, of course, there\u2019s fierce opposition to anything smacking of debt relief.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Not hard-working, thrifty small business owners and workers, although it serves the interests of the big players to pretend that it\u2019s all about protecting little guys who play by the rules. The reality is that both small businesses and workers are hurt far more by the weak economy than they would be by, say, modest inflation that helps promote recovery.\n\nNo, the only real beneficiaries of Pain Caucus policies (aside from the Chinese government) are the rentiers: bankers and wealthy individuals with lots of bonds in their portfolios.\n\nAnd that explains why creditor interests bulk so large in policy; not only is this the class that makes big campaign contributions, it\u2019s the class that has personal access to policy makers \u2014 many of whom go to work for these people when they exit government through the revolving door. The process of influence doesn\u2019t have to involve raw corruption (although that happens, too). All it requires is the tendency to assume that what\u2019s good for the people you hang out with, the people who seem so impressive in meetings \u2014 hey, they\u2019re rich, they\u2019re smart, and they have great tailors \u2014 must be good for the economy as a whole.\n\nBut the reality is just the opposite: creditor-friendly policies are crippling the economy. This is a negative-sum game, in which the attempt to protect the rentiers from any losses is inflicting much larger losses on everyone else. And the only way to get a real recovery is to stop playing that game.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-facebookJumbo-v5.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-blogSmallThumb.png", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/09/16/opinion/Krugman_New/Krugman_New-blog427.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-thumbLarge.png"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-facebookJumbo-v5.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Paul Krugman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/opinion/10krugman.html", "title": "Rule by Rentiers", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "applicationName": "article", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/1248069767691", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/opinion/10krugman.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/opinion/10krugman.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/1248069767691"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/opinion/10krugman.html", "title": "Opinion | Rule by Rentiers", "description": "Who benefits from economic stagnation?", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-thumbLarge-v7.jpg", "card": "summary", "creator": "PaulKrugman"}, "robots": "noarchive", "hdl_p": "Rule by Rentiers", "description": "Who benefits from economic stagnation?", "genre": "Op-Ed", "articleid": 1248069767691, "usageTerms": "https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893968-Terms-of-sale", "hdl": "Rule by Rentiers", "col": "Op-Ed Columnist", "pdate": 20110609, "utime": 20171026054313, "ptime": 20110609205328, "DISPLAYDATE": "June 9, 2011", "dat": "June 9, 2011", "lp": "Who benefits from economic stagnation?", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "cre": "The New York Times", "slug": "10krugman", "article": {"collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "published": "2011-06-09T20:53:28-04:00", "modified": "2017-10-26T05:43:13-04:00", "section": "Opinion", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778", "section_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "top-level-section": "opinion", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/paul-krugman", "tag": "Banking and Financial Institutions"}, "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/opinion/10krugman.html", "type": "article", "title": "Opinion | Rule by Rentiers", "description": "Who benefits from economic stagnation?", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-facebookJumbo-v5.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170, "pages": 993603507345855}, "author": "Paul Krugman", "tone": "opinion", "byl": "By PAUL KRUGMAN", "PT": "article", "CG": "opinion", "PST": "Op-Ed", "tom": "Op-Ed", "edt": "NewYork", "des": "Banking and Financial Institutions", "geo": "Europe", "keywords": "United States Economy,Credit and Debt,United States,Europe,Economic Conditions and Trends,Banking and Financial Institutions", "news_keywords": "US Economy,Debt,US,Europe,Economy,Banking and Finance", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-thumbLarge-v7.jpg", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-thumbStandard-v5.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_width": 75, "nyt-collection": {"display-name": "Paul Krugman", "identifier": "paul-krugman", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/column/paul-krugman", "uri": "/column/paul-krugman", "tone": "opinion", "tagline": "Macroeconomics, trade, health care, social policy and politics.", "type": "column"}, "CN": "paul-krugman", "CT": "column", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1307678400.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
