Ever since, warnings about the imminent attack of the \u201cbond vigilantes\u201d have been used to attack any spending on job creation.\n\nBut basic economics said that rates would stay low as long as the economy was depressed \u2014 and basic economics was right. The interest rate on 10-year bonds was 3.7 percent when The Wall Street Journal issued that warning; at the end of last week it was 3.03 percent.\n\nHow have the usual suspects responded? By inventing their own reality. Last week, Representative Paul Ryan, the man behind the G.O.P. plan to dismantle Medicare , declared that we must slash government spending to \u201ctake pressure off the interest rates\u201d \u2014 the same pressure, I suppose, that has pushed those rates to near-record lows.\n\nPhoto\n\nExcuse No. 3: It\u2019s the workers\u2019 fault.\n\nUnemployment soared during the financial crisis and its aftermath. So it seems bizarre to argue that the real problem lies with the workers \u2014 that the millions of Americans who were working four years ago but aren\u2019t working now somehow lack the skills the economy needs.\n\nYet that\u2019s what you hear from many pundits these days: high unemployment is \u201cstructural,\u201d they say, and requires long-term solutions (which means, in practice, doing nothing).\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They aren\u2019t. In fact, average wages actually fell last month.\n\nExcuse No. 4: We tried to stimulate the economy, and it didn\u2019t work.\n\nEverybody knows that President Obama tried to stimulate the economy with a huge increase in government spending, and that it didn\u2019t work. But what everyone knows is wrong.\n\nThink about it: Where are the big public works projects? Where are the armies of government workers? There are actually half a million fewer government employees now than there were when Mr. Obama took office.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo what happened to the stimulus? Much of it consisted of tax cuts, not spending. Most of the rest consisted either of aid to distressed families or aid to hard-pressed state and local governments. This aid may have mitigated the slump, but it wasn\u2019t the kind of job-creation program we could and should have had. This isn\u2019t 20-20 hindsight: some of us warned from the beginning that tax cuts would be ineffective and that the proposed spending was woefully inadequate. And so it proved.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that in another area where government could make a big difference \u2014 help for troubled homeowners \u2014 almost nothing has been done. The Obama administration\u2019s program of mortgage relief has gone nowhere: of $46 billion allotted to help families stay in their homes, less than $2 billion has actually been spent.\n\nSo let\u2019s summarize: The economy isn\u2019t fixing itself. Nor are there real obstacles to government action: both the bond vigilantes and structural unemployment exist only in the imaginations of pundits. And if stimulus seems to have failed, it\u2019s because it was never actually tried.\n\nListening to what supposedly serious people say about the economy, you\u2019d think the problem was \u201cno, we can\u2019t.\u201d But the reality is \u201cno, we won\u2019t.\u201d And every pundit who reinforces that destructive passivity is part of the problem.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-facebookJumbo-v5.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-blogSmallThumb.png", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/09/16/opinion/Krugman_New/Krugman_New-blog427.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-thumbLarge.png"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-facebookJumbo-v5.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Paul Krugman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/11/opinion/11krugman.html", "title": "No, We Can\u2019t?
