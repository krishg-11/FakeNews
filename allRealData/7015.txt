Jennifer Lopez Performs New Spanish-Language Single at the 2017 Billboard Latin Music Awards

Superstar Jennifer Lopez took the stage at the 2017 Billboard Latin Music Awards to premiere her new Spanish-language song, "Mírate."

The powerful ballad was accompanied by a full orchestra and was followed with a standing ovation from the audience, which included the proud Marc Anthony who is producing her forthcoming album.

Ahead of JLo's performance, the likes of Sofía Vergara, Lin-Manuel Miranda and J Balvin appeared in a star-studded video to congratulate the singer on her Star Award.

"It makes me very excited to share this special night with artists that I admire," an emotional JLo said in her speech as she was awarded Telemundo's special accolade.

"My family in music and in my life. To come back to my roots has a significance that goes beyond words. Moments like these are proof of hard work and we are lucky if life blesses us in this way. I love you so much. I feel blessed to be part of this creative world and to be able to represent our Latin community. I feel at home. I am humbled to be here in your presence and accept this award."
