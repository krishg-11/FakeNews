Clinton said, "Trump Management was charged with discriminating against African-Americans and breaking federal law."

The government in 1973 accused Trump, his father and Trump Management of violating the Fair Housing Act, part of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. The case alleged Trump’s realty company discriminated against non-white tenants and potential tenants at numerous apartment complexes.

Clinton’s claim is carefully phrased. For that, we rate her claim True.
