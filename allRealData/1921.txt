Employment, Hours, and Earnings from the Current Employment Statistics survey (National) Home Page

The Current Employment Statistics (CES) program produces detailed industry estimates of nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings of workers on payrolls. CES National Estimates produces data for the nation, and CES State and Metro Area produces estimates for all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and about 450 metropolitan areas and divisions.

Each month, CES surveys approximately 142,000 businesses and government agencies, representing approximately 689,000 individual worksites.

Total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 266,000 in November, and the unemployment rate was little changed at 3.5 percent. Notable job gains occurred in health care and in professional and technical services. Employment rose in manufacturing, reflecting the return of workers from a strike. | | | |
