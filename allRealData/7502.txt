Here's What Lindsay Lohan's ‘Parent Trap' Body Double Looks Like!

We all know that Lindsay Lohan had a body double in The Parent Trap because, well, there is only one Lindsay Lohan (thank god haha).

Thanks to some crazy cinematic magic, Lohan could be in two places at once for the movie, and play both roles. But for some scenes, someone else actually needed to stand in for her, their face digitally replaced with Lohan’s later on down the road.

Now, say hello to actress Erin Mackey, who played Lohan’s double in the 1998 classic. She really does look like her!
