Pauly D Left 'Shaking' After 'Hollywood Medium' Relays Message from Dead Friend (Video)

Paul "Pauly D" DelVecchio was shaken up during a reading with E!'s "Hollywood Medium."

The "Jersey Shore" star appears in a preview clip from tonight's new episode, which sees him getting a message from the other side from one of his late friends.

"My best friend in the whole entire world, he passed away like 11 years ago," Pauly said of his deceased friend, Billy Iannotti, who died in 2005. "This was like my best best friend, he passed in a motorcycle accident. We were together all the time. I don't know if there's anything you see ... the way he died, how do you go living your life one day with him every single day, then all of a sudden you don't, you live life without them?"

"I don't talk to anybody about this," he added, "I'm a public figure but I'm private in that aspect of him."

"There is a visual that's going through, the feeling is, 'If I weren't turning, I would be fine, but I'm up straight,'" Tyler Henry says. "And this is the weird thing that's coming across, 'I don't have enough time to be able to correct anything that would have gone wrong.' The feeling is, 'The center of balance isn't the center of the vehicle' ... the focus is almost like, 'I don't have the balance.'"

"I'm shaking right now hearing you say that," DelVecchio says in reaction. "That's exactly what happened."

Pauly previously gave tribute to Iannotti by getting a tattoo reading "RIP Billy" in his honor.

"Hollywood Medium with Tyler Henry" airs Wednesdays at 9am PT.
