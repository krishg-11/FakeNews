Morgan Freeman: Janet Mock recalls her unpleasant experience with Morgan Freeman

The recent allegations of Hollywood star Morgan Freeman sexually harassing women has shocked many of his fans. Now, American TV host and writer Janet Mock has revealed that just a few years ago when she interviewed Freeman, she too had an unpleasant experience. In a new interview , she described him as 'the creepy uncle at the barbecue'.Janet, who was at the time working as an on-air reporter, sat down with the veteran actor to discuss his film '5 Flights Up' (2014). In a newly published clip of their interview, you can see him asking her, "How you all manage to do that all the time?" When she asked him if he was talking about hair and make-up, he responds, "No, you got a dress that's halfway between your knee and your hips and you sit down right across from me and you cross your legs."According to Janet, Freeman knew the camera was rolling. She told a reporter later that this shows how men in power believe that they have free rein to do whatever they want. She believes that as a young woman who was just trying to do a job as a reporter, she just wanted to interview him for the movie and so, for him to turn into the 'creepy uncle at the barbecue' was strange.
