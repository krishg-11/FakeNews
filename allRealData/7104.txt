Justin Bieber Surprises Fans at Children's Hospital of Orange County

Though Justin Bieber is one of the biggest names in music and is about to embark on his first stadium tour in North America, the singer still has time for his fans and those that matter most. On Monday (July 17), Bieber surprised kids at Children’s Hospital of Orange County to meet fans, take pictures and say prayers with patients.

A number of fans and their parents took to social media to share photos of the “Despacito” singer. One mother named Brandie Runner was pleasantly surprised to see the recording artist stop by to see her daughter Victoria, sharing on Instagram, “So ... our nurse comes in and asks Victoria if she's been asked about having a visitor? We say no. … Anyone wanna guess who her visitor was?!! #justinbeiber.”

Runner captioned another photo, “What a blessing this day was to her (& I). I never knew he had this big of a heart.” Bieber spent time with several other fans, spreading smiles and hugs, and even a few dabs.
