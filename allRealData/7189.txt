Stranger Things Co-Stars Spark More Dating Rumors in Paris

Romance rumors are flying around Stranger Things stars Charlie Heaton and Natalia Dyer once again. This isn’t the first time the two have made fans wonder about their relationship; the IRL Nancy and Jonathan, who had crushes on each other in the show, have been rumored to be dating since early 2017, but still haven’t confirmed it.

Over the weekend, photographers snapped Charlie and Natalia holding hands on a leisurely stroll together in Paris. They shared a pair of earbuds and were also spotted with Charlie’s arm comfortably around Natalia’s shoulders. A cozy autumn walk around Paris is looking pretty good right now.

Holding hands obviously does not equal relationship, but fans are still thrilled about a possible pairing between the two stars.

Since the Stranger Things cast has faced so much publicity lately, we totally understand why Charlie and Natalia would want to keep a prospective romance quiet, and it’s totally their right to do so. Either way, a vacation in Paris doesn't sound too bad!
