13 pairs of the best workout leggings Well+Good readers love

When future generations dress up in retro clothing meant to signify it’s the year 2018, they’ll likely skip traditional ready-to-wear in favor of athleisure looks anchored by—what else?—leggings. This piece is, after all, the skinny jeans of a modern woman’s wardrobe.

Some may opt for non-basic black styles while others might try to pull off floral prints, stirruped tights (for more of a mixed-decades vibe), high-waisted cuts (to really nail the moment), and even “extra” bedazzled designs. Whichever the case, it’s likely brands like Lululemon, Fabletics, Athleta, Alala, Beyond Yoga, and more will feature prominently in their selections if, that is, the latest Well+Good Instagram poll is any indication. There, readers shared their leggings obsessions du jour. So, which pairs passed your squat, dance, and sweat tests? Keep scrolling to see 13 pairs of leggings Well+Good readers swear by.
