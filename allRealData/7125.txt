3 Ways To Get Boho Waves Without Heat

I don’t know about you, but in the summer the last thing I want to do is style my hair with heat. It’s just too hot to want more warmth radiating towards my head and melting off my makeup. Plus straightening my hair with a blow dryer or flat iron is a little pointless when the humidity is so high. All the moisture in the air can bring the texture back to hair in minutes.

Instead of fighting humid conditions, I find it’s best to work with them by encouraging my natural wave. Luckily, hair with texture, from loose barely-there waves to sexy tousled curls, is totally on trend. The look is the perfect complement to fashion’s current hippie-chic vibe and the carefree spirit of summer. Best of all, modern waves are best achieved by air-drying your hair, saving your locks from heat damage while you stay cool.

3 Ways to Curl Your Hair Without Heat

Tips for Perfect Air-Dried Waves

Product is your friend. Try a sea salt spray or wave-encouraging lotion if your hair is on the straight side. Mousse or curl defining cream should do the trick for hair with more bend. Be sure to run a frizz control product or shine serum over ends if you are prone to frizz or flyaways. For extra hold and humidity protection, spritz a layer of hairspray over the set before releasing your waves.

Hair should be damp but not soaking wet or it will take a really long time to dry, so if you are fresh from the shower allow it to air dry a bit before styling it.

The dryer your hair is when you release the set, the wavier your hair will be. I like to set my hair and then allow it to dry in the car on my commute to work.

If you don’t have a lot of time in the morning to allow your hair to dry, you can set it the night before bed and take it down in the morning.

Technique 1: Modern Pin Curls

If you have some wave to your hair, you might be able to simply scrunch in some product and allow your hair to air dry. To enhance waves further or soften tighter curls, I offer three ways to curl your hair without heat below. These techniques are all quick and easy but you’ll need to allow time for your hair to set. I prefer to style damp hair in the morning and allow it to air dry, but you can also set your hair the night before and wake up to pretty waves.

Supplies Needed

When it comes to wet-setting hair, it makes sense to look at the techniques that were used before modern heat styling techniques were available. Traditional pin curl sets produce a more structured curl, but this simple arrangement yields a looser wave and takes only a few minutes to style.

Step 1

Apply product to damp hair and create a vertical section in the front above one ear. This does not need to be perfectly sectioned – in fact, it’s better if it’s not perfectly straight to avoid part lines.

Step 2

Wrap the strand around your fingers away from your face to create a loop and wind the curl with your fingers down to your scalp.

Step 3

Slide a pin curl clip or duckbill clip in upwards from below to secure the strand in place. The bottom prong should sit against your scalp and the top prong should be through the center of the curl.

Step 4

Continue taking vertical sections all the way from the crown to the nape, wrap away from your face, and pin them until you reach the center in back. Try not to worry about making these pin curls perfect. Think quick and easy; just wrap the curl, pin it, and move on.

Step 5

Repeat on the other side of your head, wrapping in the opposite direction (still away from your face.)

Step 6

Wait for your hair to dry and then remove the clips.

Step 7

Run your fingers through the curls to break them up and soften them.

Technique 2: Braid Waves

Supplies Needed

Styling product (I used Redken Guts 10 Volume Foam Spray and White Sands The Cure 24/7)

Two small hair elastic bands

Hair clip

Braids create a wonderful wavy texture to hair. To update this technique, I started my braids a little farther down and then pulled them wider so that my waves would be looser.

Step 1

Add product to damp hair and then part down the center and clip one side out of the way.

Step 2

Take a large section to start with from about an inch above your ear to the center part. Divide this into 3 equal sections.

Step 3

Dutch braid (reverse French) the entire side by incorporating hair as you work toward your nape and fold the strands under. For more detailed instructions on how to create a Dutch braid, visit this post. When you reach the nape, continue braiding the three strands to the ends and tie off with a small hair band. Repeat on the other side.

Step 4

Gently tug on both sides of both braid to loosen and widen them.

Step 5

When hair is dry, remove the elastic bands and run your fingers through your hair to tousle the waves.

Technique 3: Twisted Texture

Supplies Needed

Styling product (I used Redken Guts 10 Volume Foam Spray and Kevin Murphy Shimmer.Shine)

Two small hair elastic bands

Twisting your hair is a great way to create the natural looking waves that are so popular these days. There are lots of ways to set your hair in twists, but this is my favorite.

Step 1

Apply product to damp hair and create 4 sections. Part hair down the center in the back and then divide each side by parting from the top to behind your ear.

Step 2

Grab the back two sections and twist them towards each other all the way down to the ends.

Step 3

Tie the ends together with a small hair band.

Step 4

Release the two front sections and twist them towards each other (away from your face), then tie the ends together with a small hair band. You’ll notice that the bottom twists have started to loosen, which is perfectly fine.

Step 5

Allow your hair to dry while in the twists, then remove the elastic bands and shake out your waves.
