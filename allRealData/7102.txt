#DemBabies: The Best Twitter Reactions To Beyonc√© and Jay‚Äôs Twins Sir Carter And Rumi

After a short social media hiatus, superstar Beyonc√© posted the first photos of her twins Rumi & Sir with husband rap legend Jay Z on Instagram. And the Internet lost its mind!

Here are the best Twitter reactions to her baby announcement:

BEYONCE PICS WITH HER TWINS ALREADY DONE MADE ME THICKER, HAIR LONGER, CURED MY HEARTBURN AND SAVED ME 15% ON MY CAR INSURANCE. ‚Äî #GirlsTrip (@girlstripmovie) July 14, 2017

That Beyonc√© level of "you'll know my business only when I decide to tell you" is definitely a level to aspire to. ‚Äî Cardi B (@StripperPoIe) July 15, 2017

Beyonc√©'s twins already made my skin clearer, cured my depression and restored my ability to love ‚Äî Matt Bellassai (@MattBellassai) July 14, 2017

If there's one thing I've learned from Beyonc√©, it's the art of controlling your narrative. No one does it better. ‚Äî W·ªçl√© II (@Kingwole) July 14, 2017

Black Twitter also addressed some of the backlash Queen Bey has gotten from some salty white women:

So many celebs have debuted their children on magazine covers, etc. for money but Beyonc√© posts a pic on IG for free and is a narcissist.. pic.twitter.com/rYzcOgPEb6 ‚Äî ‚ôï AÃ∂NÃ∂GÃ∂EÃ∂LÃ∂ ‚ôï (@IBeenCrowned) July 15, 2017

It's interesting, white women didn't really start showing their asses in regards to Beyonce until she reaffirmed her blackness with lemonade ‚Äî Mike Tr√© (@TheMikeTre) July 15, 2017

Beyonc√© is NOT a psychopath or narcissist for the photoshoot. Y'all need to stop looking foolish, using psych words you don't understand. ‚Äî TheBlackDorianGray (@QueeringPsych) July 14, 2017

White women: I wonder what Beyonc√© is doing at this exact moment. I want to be mad for no good reason at all. Beyonc√©: *post picture* WW: pic.twitter.com/bBNSoQ360j ‚Äî MistyKnightsTwistOut (@Steph_I_Will) July 14, 2017

I don't need to hear about how extra Beyonc√© is being from the race that brought us that "shoot a smoke bomb to reveal the baby's sex" shoot ‚Äî Louisa üçûüåπüåπ (@LouisatheLast) July 14, 2017

WP: Black women are welfare queens Beyonc√©: I dream it, I work hard, I grind til I own it. WP: we've gotta stop this Black power nonsense https://t.co/iqQSg2NaTM ‚Äî Jill Smith (@JillSmith555) July 14, 2017

Beyonc√© has suffered multiple miscarriages & marital turmoil, and is now revelling in the joy of having healthy twins. LET HER. pic.twitter.com/UlpJ6uZ42U ‚Äî Micaiah (@NotSoRatchet) July 14, 2017
