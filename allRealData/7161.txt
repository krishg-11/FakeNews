Regina King reveals a ‘This Is Us’ detail

Details about “This Is Us” plots are guarded as if they’re state secrets. But Regina King, who directed an episode in the upcoming season, offered a tiny glimpse of what’s to come.

“I think there’s one thing I can tell you without getting into trouble with NBC,” she said during E!’s red carpet coverage. “In my episode, you get to meet the ‘Big Three’ in a decade that you’ve never seen them before.”

Hmm, you don’t say? “This Is Us,” the college years, maybe? Let the guesswork begin.

King won a best supporting actress two years in a row for “American Crime,” and she’s back again as a nominee.

“It was a little disappointing,” she said about the show’s recent cancellation, “but, look, we got an opportunity to do some really great storytelling for three seasons.”
