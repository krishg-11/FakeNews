Busy Philipps Responds to Backlash Over Her Post on the Anniversary of Heath Ledger's Death

It's been 10 years since Heath Ledger died of an accidental drug overdose. Since Ledger's passing, life has not been the same for his former girlfriend Michelle Williams, who's the mother to his 12-year-old daughter, Matilda. "It just won't ever be right," Williams has said of raising their daughter alone.

But when the milestone anniversary of Ledger's death rolled around, Williams' close friend Busy Philipps did her best to comfort her grieving pal, flying to San Francisco to be by her side. On that January day, Philipps — who has a huge following on social media — posted a photo of Williams nuzzling her shoulder. Her caption: "It's OK." She'd also posted an Instagram story of herself crying as she drove around listening to a song that reminded her of Ledger.

Reactions to the posts were mixed, with some fans seeming to think that Philipps was capitalizing on the tragedy for her own personal gain. "I think some people felt like I was being exploitative,” she told The Cut. “I’ve never even really spoken about [Ledger’s death], because I never would want to have it be misconstrued in that way, but it was the ten-year anniversary."

Reportedly crying through the rest of her statement, Philipps said: "It’s just been a long ten years, you know? That anniversary just brought up a lot of … I can’t believe it’s been ten years. I was pregnant with Birdie. I had seen him a couple months earlier, and you know, [Williams and Ledger] were broken up. I’ve never talked about it. I’ve never shared it, because I’m hyper protective of [Williams] and her daughter. But I also think … I think it’s okay. Everyone’s allowed to have their own feelings about something that happens."
