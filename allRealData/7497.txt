Jackée Harry Reunites With Tamera Mowry After Confirming the Sister, Sister Reboot

Lisa Landry, er, Jackée Harry, is one proud mom! The Sister, Sister actress recently reunited with onscreen daughter Tamera Mowry for her birthday, and it's making us super nostalgic. "I had such a great time celebrating @tameramowrytwo's 40th!" she wrote alongside a photo of them sharing a sweet embrace. "Can you believe these girls are all grown up?" While Mowry's identical twin sister, Tia, wasn't pictured for the special reunion, we have a feeling the onscreen family will be getting back together very soon.

In January, Harry confirmed that a Sister, Sister reboot is in the works during an appearance on Steve Harvey's show. "Yeah, it's happening. I'm excited," she said. "Tia and Tamera [Mowry] are my babies! They won't leave me alone. I can't get rid of none of these women!" We can't wait to see the whole gang back on our screens!
