Chrissy Teigen got 'low key dissed' by Kermit the Frog on Twitter

And now for the most random clash of celebrity worlds of the day…

Chrissy Teigen is well-known of course for ruling Twitter (including expressing her views on Naked Attraction, expressing her abhorrence at being constantly tagged in John Legend baby lookalike pictures, and telling fans what really happened when hubby John Legend once tried to break up with her).

Now she has won the social media platform again, this time with help from a partner in crime, who just happens to be a Muppet (literally).

She recently asked people to share the tattoo they used to want more than anything but are glad they didn’t go through with.

She told people her own…

what is a tattoo you wanted when you were younger but, thankfully, never got? mine is kermit — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 21, 2017

… before getting burned by the ‘It’s Not Easy Being Green’ singer himself.

Whew! Glad to hear it. Now I don't feel so bad about not getting that @chrissyteigen tattoo. https://t.co/GGw5qFsxDG — Kermit the Frog (@KermitTheFrog) September 21, 2017

Chrissy didn’t mind too much though, and could appreciate that she’d been had.

I think kermit just low key dissed me I love him even more now https://t.co/A79dpSb5QK — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 21, 2017
