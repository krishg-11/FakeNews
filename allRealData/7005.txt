Selena Gomez and The Weeknd packed on the PDA at Coachella this weekend, even sharing an affectionate selfie on Instagram.

The pic on Gomez's account appears a week after The Weeknd shared a romantic one on his own page. So, clearly, they're a couple.

The duo was at the Indio, Calif., music festival Saturday, hanging out in the VIP section and watching acts including Travis Scott. The Weeknd did more than enjoy the music from backstage: He made a surprise appearance during Nav's set.

Other unexpected singers at the festival Saturday included Drake, Lauryn Hill, Tyler the Creator and Migos.
