Thor: Ragnarok features Marvel's first ever LGBT+ character in a movie

We’ve only waited nine years…

When Thor: Ragnarok comes to cinemas screens across the world this weekend, it brings with it the first ever LGBT+ character in a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie.

Despite the film not making it explicit in any way, Tessa Thompson has confirmed that her character Valkyrie is bisexual.

She’s bi. And yes, she cares very little about what men think of her. What a joy to play! https://t.co/d0LZKTHCfL — Tessa Thompson (@TessaThompson_x) October 21, 2017

“She’s bi. And yes, she cares very little about what men think of her. What a joy to play!” Tessa tweeted.

She was responding to a fan thread where one user was complaining that Valkyrie has been turned into a “typical sexless marvel tomboy” compared to her comicbook counterpart.

Tessa Thompson stars alongside Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk in Marvel’s latest blockbuster instalment.

Cate Blanchett and Jeff Goldblum both star too in the intergalactic adventure, which will be in cinemas on 24 October in the UK and 3 November in the US.

There’s still no word on whether the big screen portrayal of Korg can be considered the MCU’s first gay character in a movie, as in the comics he was in a gay relationship with another member of the Warbound called Hiroim.

“We wanted to change the idea of what a hulking guy made of rocks could be. He’s huge and heavy, but with a light soul,” director Takia Waititi previously said, who also voices the CGI creation.

“We wanted to make him funny and a relatable entry point into this world. And Thor needs friends.”
