Harrison Ford channeled his inner Han Solo when he rushed to the rescue of a woman who crashed her car in California on Sunday.

The “Star Wars” actor was driving east on a freeway near Santa Barbara when the female driver in front of him lost control of her ride, swerved off the road and smashed into an embankment, according to TMZ.

Ford switched into action-hero mode — slamming on his brakes and swooping in to help.

Sporting his own version of a superhero costume — a sensible button-down shirt and sunglasses — the 75-year-old star bolted to her gray sedan.

He and other good Samaritans then pulled her from the car as paramedics arrived, a witness told the celebrity news site.

The lucky lady was transported from the site of the accident, on California State Route 126, to a hospital.

She suffered only minor injuries, law-enforcement sources told the site.

It’s not the first time the actor has played a noble role off screen.

In September, a Midtown tunnel pile-up cause his Mercedes Benz to get stuck between cars, so he hopped out and began directing traffic, video footage shows.

Ford was also recently the victim of an accident himself when engine trouble forced him to land his private plane on a golf course in Santa Monica in 2015.

The Oscar-nominated actor has appeared in movies such as “Indiana Jones,” “Patriot Games” and “The Fugitive.”
