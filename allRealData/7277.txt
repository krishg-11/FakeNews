The Kendall Jenner-Approved Winter Jacket That'll Actually Keep You Warm

Kendall Jenner is keeping warm this season!

The supermodel shared a pic on her Instagram on Wednesday, wearing an oversized red puffer jacket by Tna from one of our favorite affordable brands, Aritzia.

Aptly named "The Super Puff," the heavy-duty water repellant winter topper is created to keep you warm down to -22°F and contains responsibly sourced goose down, which Jenner styled with rigid jeans, a ringer tee and netted pumps.

Jenner isn't the only star to don the puffer. Fellow celebs Bella Hadid, Emma Roberts and Karlie Kloss have added the $228 piece to their fall/winter wardrobe.

So if you're looking for a coat that'll actually do the job in freezing temps, but will still look fashion-forward, take note from the KUWTK star and try the voluminous puffer on for size. Shop the It girl's exact one ahead -- available in 14 other colors from black to lavender -- along with our other favorite picks.
