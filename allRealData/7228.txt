Corrections/clarifications: An earlier version of this story misstated the number of David Foster's children. He has five biological children and six stepchildren.

Congrats are in order for Katharine McPhee and David Foster. They're engaged!

The Canadian composer, 68, popped the question to the actress and singer, 34, during their European vacation this week, Foster's rep Kimberly Jakwerth confirmed to USA TODAY Tuesday.

McPhee seemingly commented on the engagement Tuesday by sharing a gif to Twitter with a ring emoji.

"And what about it?" the gif reads.

The happy couple have been vacationing in Italy, according to their social media accounts.

Although a ring is not visible, they seem to be enjoying the sunny weather and snapping photos of each other.

McPhee also shared a screenshot conversation between her and Just Jared founder Jared Eng that details how Foster proposed.

"He did it at the top of this mountain in Anacapri... Totally dark only stars... Thankfully he didn't push me off the cliff... He said it was one or the other. And in the end he spared me," she wrote with a laughing emoji.

The couple reportedly began dating last year. Their most recent appearance was at the 2018 Met Gala in May, where they walked the red carpet together arm-in-arm. In March, they also attended the Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Awards viewing party together.

Foster has been previously married four times. From 2011 to 2017, he was married to Yolanda Hadid, the mother of supermodels Gigi and Bella Hadid. He does not share any children with Hadid, but has five biological children with other partners.

McPhee was married to actor Nick Cokas from 2008 to 2016.
