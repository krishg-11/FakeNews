I did it because Madonna labeled her non-adopted child as a '#1' and her adopted child as a '#2'.



Now THAT is something that should leave a sour taste in your mouth, boo. Reply

Same. I'm surprised they didn't include "biological" in Lourde's description. Reply

1). she knows it's Gypsy ROSE Lee, right?

2). i feel like North Americans have noooo idea that the term gypsy is offensive. i barely knew until i was about 22 years old and took a History course with an Eastern European woman who explained why Reply

I didn't know gypsy was offensive for ages tbh and I'm from the UK. I assumed it was the preferred term cos it was the most often used.



Our clients who are travellers use 'Gypsy' in their company names

people in europe (i can only talk about germany because that's where i live) either don't know that it's offensive or they just don't care. in most cases i think it's the latter though. Reply

I think like a lot of Americans would put gypsies in the same category as leprechauns. Reply

I'm from Portugal, and I don't think it's considered a slur here. I can't speak for them, but I don't think they find the term offensive. (the portuguse word for it "cigano")

Every sophomore at my high school had to complete a research paper in history on a topic of their choice, and I chose Roma persecution during the first half of the twentieth century. Even my teacher, a white lib fem socialist, constantly referred to my topic as "gypsies" Reply

Didn't she make a huge deal about how poorly the Roma were treated in France, though? She knows, she just doesn't actually give a fuck. Reply

It's really weird to me how older people that used to preach about this kind of ignorance (like Madonna, RuPaul, etc.) are now the out of touch people that either have no idea how stupid they look, or just don't care. Like, when does that changeover happen? Around 50? Reply

for entertainment ppl it probably happens when they get so rich that their friend circles are exclusively rich & as conservative as their gender/race/orietation will alow it Reply

totally. I always think this about baby boomers in general, how they were enmeshed and active in the era of the civil rights movement, free love, anti-war, etc., yet so many of them became so obtuse and closed minded about issues like that as they got older.



ironically, it seems like those experiences have ultimately worked against them. they feel entitled to be offensive and awful because they've been through a time when things were worse, so now they're like "this is nothing compared to how things were in MY day! get over it!" they think they know everything there is to know.
