Charlize Theron still upset Aeon Flux didn’t work

If Charlize Theron’s new action film Atomic Blonde is a hit, she’ll have her 2005 flop Aeon Flux to thank.

The Mad Max: Fury Road star took on the film following her Best Actress Oscar win for 2003’s Monster because she was eager to portray a no-nonsense female assassin and work with director Karyn Kusama, but their movie was not a hit among critics who gave it a big thumbs down.

“I got offered a lot of stuff in action movies that was either the girl behind the computer or the wife,” she tells Variety magazine. “When Aeon Flux came to me, I thought that could be something. I was never completely sold on the entire concept, but I really loved Karyn Kusama’s movie (Girlfight). So I threw myself into that with the belief that she’s a great filmmaker.”

“And then we f**ked it all up,” she says laughing. “I just don’t think we really knew how to execute it. And it’s disappointing, but it happens. I’ve been in this business long enough to know that you cannot get it right every time.”

Charlize finally got to play her perfect female protagonist, a tough as nails spy, in Atomic Blonde, and she’s convinced the new David Leitch movie will be a hit among fans and critics alike.

The actress admits her character, Lorraine Broughton, left her intrigued when she read the script because she had never seen a woman like that on the big screen.

“I might have gotten this right because of that (Aeon Flux),” she smiles. “You know nothing about this woman. It’s so rare that a female gets that in a movie.”
