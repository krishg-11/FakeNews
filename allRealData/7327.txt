Bruno Mars Gives Longtime Girlfriend a Shoutout at Grammys

Bruno Mars won big at the 2018 Grammys on Sunday, January 28. While accepting the award for Record of the Year, Mars paid tribute to his stunning girlfriend, Jessica Caban. "My lady, Jessica, I love you baby,” Mars gushed onstage. “Thank you for being my rock and being on my side throughout this whole process."

Bruno, 32, and Jessica, 35, have been together for almost a decade. In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine in 2016, Bruno was asked if he plans on proposing to the model. "Jesus! She's my best friend. My rock. What's wrong with that? We're just happy,” he said, "Until she reads this."

Bruno previously revealed that he wrote hit song “When I Was Your Man” about Jessica when he felt like he was losing her. "You're bringing up all these old emotions again," he told Rolling Stone about how it’s hard to perform considering they’re still together. "It's just like bleeding!"
