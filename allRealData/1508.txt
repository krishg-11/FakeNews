More Czars Than the Romanovs

Meet Obama's Czars

With the Obama Administration's latest creation of a new czar position - the pay czar, announced Wednesday - TPM decided to take a look at just how many have been named so far.



When he announced his 9th czar, Obama already had more than any other President. We gave him a break and didn't include the special envoys - like George Mitchell to the Middle East - considered czars by some. Despite that, there are still upwards of 20 (and more to come, for cyber security and intellectual property). John McCain's words ring true: Obama has more czars than the Romanovs.

Drug Czar

Czar R. Gil Kerlikowske



What it means:



The former police chief of Seattle, Kerlikowske was sworn in as the the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy on May 7. According to the official website, he "coordinates all aspects of Federal drug control programs and implementation of the President's National Drug Control Strategy."

Energy Czar

Czar Carol Browner



What it means:



Officially the Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change, this is what Obama said at the press conference announcing her nomination: "Carol understands that our efforts to create jobs, achieve energy security and combat climate change demand integration among different agencies, cooperation between federal, state and local governments and partnership with the private sector."

Auto Recovery Czar

Czar Ed Montgomery



What it means:



Montgomery is the director of recovery for auto communities and workers - he's spent time in Detroit at workshops "on applying for federal grants and other financial assistance." The title can possibly be shared with Steve Rattner, who the NYT calls the "car czar lite" - "one of 14 people on a committee that is orchestrating the rescue of the giant automakers."

Urban Affairs Czar

Czar Adolfo Carrion, Jr.



What it means:



As head of the new White House Office of Urban Affairs, this former Bronx Borough President is in charge of the planning and execution of all urban affairs policy and programs. According to the National Journal, Carrion will also "work across traditional Cabinet divisions to coordinate health, education and environmental initiatives in American's cities."

Information Czar

Czar Vivek Kundra



What it means:



Officially the Federal Chief Information Officer at the White House, Kundra "directs the policy and strategic planning of federal information technology investments and is responsible for oversight of federal technology spending."

Technology Czar

Czar Aneesh Chopra



What it means:

Chopra works with Kundra and Chief Performance Officer (or Performance Czar) Jeffrey Zients, not pictured.

The White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs "oversees regulations throughout the government, from the Environmental Protection Agency to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration...the job will be crucial as the new administration overhauls financial-services regulations, attempts to pass universal health care and tries to forge a new approach to controlling emissions of greenhouse gases."

Bailout Czar (or TARP Czar)

Czar Herb Allison



What it means:



This former Fannie Mae CEO is overseeing the Troubled Assets Relief Program, the $700 billion bank bailout that happened under Bush.

Stimulus Accountability Czar

Czar Earl Devaney

Devaney oversees the $787 billion stimulus package passed earlier this year ("the kind of guy you'd want guarding your cash," Devaney is a former Secret Service agent who investigated Jack Abramoff).

Border Czar

Czar Alan Bersin



What it means:



Bersin, who had a similar position under the Clinton Administration, is working with Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to curb the violence and trafficking of drugs along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Non-Proliferation Czar
