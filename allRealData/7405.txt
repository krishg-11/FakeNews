Jared Leto is hitchhiking across America to promote 30 Seconds To Mars’ new album

Jared Leto has been hitchhiking across America to promote his band 30 Seconds To Mars‘ new album, which is titled ‘America’.

‘America’ is the group’s fifth record to date and follows on from 2013’s ‘Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams’. It will be released on Friday (April 6).

A press release details how Leto has intended to “travel across America” by “any means possible” for a week to promote the release, stating that the actor-turned-singer has been using transport methods ranging from “trains, planes, automobiles, Greyhound bus, Lyft rides, bicycles” to “NASCAR pit stops and more”.

Leto has been visiting “unique destinations that showcase the title subject of the band’s album” and, to “further showcase what America is made of”, has given out genetic testing kits along the way.

Leto appeared on The Tonight Show earlier this week to kick off his journey, which saw A$AP Rocky giving him a ride. Watch that clip beneath.

During his stop in Austin, Leto performed outside coffee shops while backed by a choir. See footage of his performances below.
