On July 1, the entire “Jurassic Park” trilogy will be available for fans to stream, along with “The Boondock Saints,” “The Princess Diaries,” and “Happy Gilmore.”

Netflix’s July lineup also promises plenty of opportunities for laughs, with “Jim Jefferies: This Is Me Now” and “The Comedy Lineup” becoming available for streaming.
