3/8/14 Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH) delivers Weekly GOP Address on American jobs

Published on Mar 8, 2014

In the Weekly Republican Address, Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio outlines a Senate Republican Jobs for America plan designed to bring back opportunity, spark an economic recovery and make it possible again for every citizen to have a shot at the American Dream. President Obama and congressional Democrats have tried to tax, spend and regulate American prosperity, says Portman, but those ideas haven't worked. "We know we can do better, and it starts by putting our trust back in the American people," says Portman, who calls for reforming the corporate tax code, ratifying free trade agreements and approving construction of the Keystone pipeline, among other ideas.
