Jenelle Evans‘ father was only in her life for a brief period of time during her childhood, but she still considered herself to be “daddy’s little girl.”

Come July 25, Evans, 25, who has long had a tense relationship with her mother, Barbara Evans, will open up about her estranged relationship with her father in her soon-to-be released memoir, Read Between the Lines: From the Diary of a Teenage Mom.

“Robert Evans was only in my life for a little while. For that short and glorious time, I was daddy’s little girl,” Evans writes in Read Between the Lines, according to E! News, who obtained a first look of the book. “I loved and admired him. I still do in some way. Without warning everything changed, and my dad cut himself out of my life.”

In her memoir, the mother of three admits, “Even now, as a grown woman, we don’t talk. Maybe one day that will change. Maybe one day we can find one another, get to know each other, and he can finally be my father. Until then, he is just my biological dad.”

The memoir will also touch on the failed marriage of the Teen Mom 2 star’s parents. “It was rocky enough not to last, and that says enough on its own, I suppose,” she writes, according to E! News.

Readers will learn about “Jenelle’s complicated life before her newfound fame,” according to the memoir’s description on Amazon, including “an overbearing mother. Erratic siblings” and “a father who didn’t seem to care.”

“I’m getting excited yet nervous for you all to read my old diary entries and see another side you haven’t known!” Evans wrote on June 1, when she shared the memoir’s cover on Instagram.
