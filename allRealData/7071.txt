Kendall Jenner Only Spent $90 on Fall's Biggest Earring Trend

One of my favorite pastimes is hunting down the best cheap thrills, aka pieces that don't cost much but can quickly make any outfit more stylish in seconds. It's why, naturally, I kind of lose it when I see celebs taking a break from their designer wardrobes to show off their latest affordable fashion finds, too. (Celebs… They're just like us, right?) Last week during New York Fashion Week, Kendall Jenner wore a pair of $90 earrings on repeat that hit on this fall's biggest jewelry trend—and I'm pretty much sold on them now.

The simple drop earrings from Vita Fede nail the chain-link jewelry trend that we're seeing everywhere right now. From a taping of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon to fashion week parties, she proved the earrings are the perfect jewelry piece for any occasion. Ahead, see how Jenner wore her trendy chain-link earrings four times in the same week, and then shop them for yourself (because I know you'll want to).
