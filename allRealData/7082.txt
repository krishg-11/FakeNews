32 actors who were replaced by other stars to play the same character

Terrence Howard played Iron Man's friend James "Rhodey" Rhodes in the first "Iron Man" movie, but didn't return for the sequel and was replaced by Don Cheadle.

During an interview on "Watch What Happens Live," Howard revealed that the money offer he had originally received for the movie deals weren't up to par when he went to resign for the second one — and blamed star Robert Downey Jr. for the difference.

"It turns out that the person I helped become Iron Man...when it was time to re-up for the second one, [he] took the money that was supposed to go to me and pushed me out," he said. "We did a three-picture deal, so that means that you did the deal ahead of time. It was going to be a certain amount for the first one, a certain amount for the second one, a certain amount for the third. They came to me with the second and said, 'Look, we will pay you one-eighth of what we contractually had for you, because we think the second one will be successful with or without you.' And I called my friend — that I helped get the first job — and he didn't call me back for three months."

Cheadle has played Rhodey/War Machine in all subsequent films.
