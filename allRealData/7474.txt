Teen takes Danny DeVito cutout to prom and he responds perfectly

I couldn’t find myself a date in real life or with an actual human. So I bought one on Amazon.

I have always loved Danny. I loved him on It’s Always Sunny in Philedelphia, I loved him in Hercules and Matilda. I just love him in every form he takes.

Danny was there for me when I really needed him. He treats me the way a woman should be treated.
