Sept. 7 (UPI) -- Taylor Swift battles actor Andy Samberg in a new ad for AT&T-DirecTV.

The 27-year-old singer takes on the 39-year-old Brooklyn Nine-Nine star, gobbles cookie dough and returns to the studio in the commercial for Taylor Swift NOW.

The ad follows a fictional day in Swift's life, including her "unbelievable choreographed fight sequence" with Samberg. The pair previously collaborated on a skit for a 2014 episode of Saturday Night Live.

"Such a taxing day when they're like 'eat some cookie dough' and you're like 'ok I'll make this sacrifice for my art,' Swift captioned a behind-the-scenes video from the commercial's shoot.

Taylor Swift NOW is a curated video catalog available to AT&T customers via the company's DirecTV Now streaming service. Swift signed a multi-year deal with AT&T in October for future performances and content.

"We're thrilled to reach a deal to bring Taylor and her unique talents to her fans and our customers in new and exclusive ways," AT&T entertainment group CEO John Stankey said at the time.

Swift will release her sixth studio album, Reputation, on Nov. 10, which includes the single "Look What You Made Me Do."
