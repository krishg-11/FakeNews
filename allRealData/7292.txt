• Golden Globes: number of viewers 2019

In 2019, a total of 18.6 million Americans watched the Golden Globes ceremony, continuing the small viewer decline which has been consistent since 2017. Viewership of the Golden Globes has always been prone to fluctuation, with sharp drops in viewers between some years before a gradual increase, followed by another decline. The year 2004 was a good one for the Globes with almost 27 million viewers tuning into the televised ceremony.The Golden Globes aim to celebrate excellence in film and television and many famous stars have received awards for their work in the industry, though significantly more men than women have been nominated for accolades recognizing their movie direction work. Between 2010 and 2018, a total of 38 men were nominated for the Golden Globe award for Best Director , compared to just two women. Gender equality in Hollywood has been and will likely continue to be a hot topic in the media as key figures strive to raise awareness of disparity and inequality, but for now the figures speak for themselves.The 2019 Golden Globe winners for Best Actress in 2019 included Glenn Close and Olivia Colman, and Rami Malek and Christian Bale each won Best Actor awards. Bale has enjoyed a prolific career in Hollywood but one of his better known roles is as Batman in ‘The Dark Knight’ , where he starred with late actor Heath Ledger. Sadly Ledger, passed away during the movie’s production, but received the Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role posthumously for his performance as the Joker. Heath Ledger’s rendition of the Joker was considered highly favorable in the U.S., ranking only slightly behind Jack Nicholson, who viewers rated as their favorite actor who portrayed Batman’s nemesis.
