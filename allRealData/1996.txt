Broad City

Created by UCB alums Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer, Broad City is an odd-couple comedy about two best friends navigating life in New York City. Abbi and Ilana are broke and flawed, and they don’t shy away from the sticky situations NYC throws at them – they dive right into the muck. No matter how bad it gets, these broads are always down to tackle whatever hits them.
