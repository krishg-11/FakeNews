Turns out Victoria Beckham wasn't pissed off at the royal wedding... She was relieved

Turns out Victoria Beckham wasn't pissed off at the royal wedding... She was relieved

If you didn't watch the royal wedding over the weekend, here's what you missed.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle got married.

Reverend Michael Curry was a shining star and also the breath of fresh air we all needed and craved so much.

Prince Phillip looked very old and confused.

And Victoria Beckham didn't smile.

That last occurance, as we all know, is nothing new.

For years now, VB has taken it upon herself not to smile whenever she's out and about. It happens often enough, we're all used to it.

And according to Victoria, it's because the fashion industry has "stolen" her smile and that she doesn't crack one out out of respect to the industry.

Fair.

This weekend though, Victoria wasn't lamenting the fact that fashion had stolen her ability to break out her pearly whites.

She was actually relieved... because she wasn't pregnant.

Probably our default state, to be honest.

Victoria told The Evening Standard she was delighted she wasn't expecting a child at this royal wedding, like she was back in 2011 when she attended Will and Kate's big day.

She said:

"Quite honestly, it was such a relief not to be hugely pregnant at this royal wedding that it was a joy to be able to choose anything I wanted to wear."

VB also recognised that her outfits from both weddings were similar enough, saying: "I love navy."

Fair, girl.

Same.

The fashion icon went on to say that the wedding was lovely and that she had a great day.

She said:

"It was such a beautiful, incredible wedding. It was just the best day. "They looked so happy, and everybody was just so happy for them. Meghan seems like a genuinely lovely woman, who really loves him."
