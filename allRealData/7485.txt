'Dancing with the Stars' pros Jenna Johnson and Val Chmerkovskiy are engaged

Like brother, like brother.

Last year, Maksim Chmerkovskiy married fellow "Dancing with the Stars" pro Peta Murgatroyd.

Thursday, his brother, Valentin Chmerkovskiy, and his girlfriend and "DWTS" colleague, Jenna Johnson, announced their engagement.

In a simple, straightforward tweet from Venice, Italy, Johnson wrote: "#ENGAGED @iamValC," which is Chmerkovskiy's Twitter handle.

But it's the two accompanying pictures that really stir the emotions.

In the first one, a shocked Johnson stands with her hands over her mouth as Chmerkovskiy kneels to propose, his hand extended while holding a ring. We can figure out her answer even without the tweet's text in the next photo, as Johnson leans down to kiss her brand new fiance.

Chmerkovskiy shared his sentiments in another tweet: "I can't wait to make you my wife."

It's the latest happy news for Johnson. In May, she won the shortened, athletes-only season of "Dancing" with her celebrity partner, Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon.
