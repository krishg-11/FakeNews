Carson Daly‘s stepfather, Richard Caruso, has passed away a little over a month after the death of Daly’s mother.

“Pops passed away today with absolute dignity & pride,” the “Today” show host announced on social media Tuesday. “The greatest man we ever knew. Our hero. He exemplified great faith, loyalty to family & hard work. He provided us all with so much. We’re grateful. His legacy lives on in all of us & anyone who had the pleasure of meeting him.”

He continued, “He’s reunited with mom now. Our faith remains strong. Thanks for your continued thoughts and prayers.”

Earlier on Tuesday, Daly explained to a fan asking why he’s been absent from “Today” that he’d had a “rough month” and his dad’s health was “in peril.” At the time, Daly planned to return to “Today” on Thursday, although it’s not clear if that’s changed since Caruso’s passing.

Caruso’s cause of death is unknown.

The TV host’s mom, Pattie Daly Caruso, died in September after suffering a sudden heart attack.
