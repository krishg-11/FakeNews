Joni Ernst "Promises" Ad

Published on Jul 7, 2014

A coalition of environmental groups including the League of Conservation Voters, Sierra Club and Environmental Defense Action Fund today announced a new nearly $1 million effort to defeat Joni Ernst and elect Bruce Braley to the U.S. Senate in November. To kick off the coalition effort, LCV is launching a television ad highlighting extremists like Sarah Palin and the Koch Brothers are supporting Ernst so she can enact their extreme agenda. The ad, "Promises," starts running this week in the Cedar Rapids and Des Moines media markets.
