Mary J Blige Claims She Wants To Do A Superhero Movie Following The Release Of Black Panther

Last night’s Academy Awards was an incredible event, so much so that even celebrities themselves found themselves star-struck by people like Meryl Streep. For example, during the ceremony, last night, Tiffany Haddish – the Girls Trip star – jumped over the velvet rope to meet Meryl.

In an interview with E! News, Mary J Blige, the actress, and singer, spoke with Zuri Hall and revealed what her favorite part of the event was. According to the singer, who is going through a divorce right now, the most exciting part has nothing to do with the nominations.

Mary said, for her, the best moment was meeting and seeing people that she’s always wanted to meet. She said, “I saw some of the cast from Black Panther, which made me excited.”

Mary added that it was a real honor to meet Chadwick Boseman as well as Lupita Nyong’O. Blige claimed the new Black Panther meant a lot to her and possibly even the culture at large.

When Zuri asked her if she would like to star in a movie such as Black Panther, Mary said, “I hope so!” Last night, Mary received two Academy Award nominations for the first time.

Mary was on the red carpet because of her performance of the track, “Mighty River,” in the movie Mudbound, a song which received critical acclaim on varying levels.

And while Mary was excited to speak with reporters, her mind was focused elsewhere. Admittedly, Blige was in a hurry to mingle with other celebs. She said, “Ok, enough talking. I’m going to go party now!”
