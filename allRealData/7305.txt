The stars aligned at the Golden Globe Awards on Sunday evening in Los Angles, when the lead actors of emotional teen film The Fault in Our Stars Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort were reunited.

Woodley attended Sunday’s awards ceremony along with her fellow Big Little Lies costars and was nominated in the category of Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Miniseries, or Motion Picture for TV for her role in the HBO hit but lost out to Laura Dern. Elgort was also nominated for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy for playing the part of getaway driver baby in Baby Driver. He lost out to James Franco in The Disaster Artist.

Based on the novel by John Green, The Fault in Our Stars tells the story of a 16-year-old girl with cancer (Woodley) who meets and falls for 17-year-old Augustus Waters (Elgort), an ex-basketball player and amputee.

Despite neither winning an accolade, the duo seemed happy enough just bumping into one another in the ballroom and cuddled up for a snap.

“She deserves all happiness in the world,” Elgort wrote on Instagram alongside the image. “To be in the same room at the Golden Globes with a woman who helped guide me early in my career when she was already a Golden Globe nominee, was a surreal moment. Life coming full circle.”
