Taylor Swift is 'stoked' to hang out with J.K. Rowling and Adele in London

Taylor Swift is loving chilling with her British besties in London!

It’s not unusual for the singer to snap pics with celebrity pals, and on Monday morning Swift gave fans the London edition, posting a pic of a couple of Polaroids in which she can be seen posing alongside none other than Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling and powerhouse singer Adele after they attended one of her recent performances.

“I’m so grateful for these women, for the words they’ve written and the worlds they’ve created through their art..,” Swift gushed in the caption alongside photos of her cuddling up to each of the woman individually. “So stoked to have you at the show in London @adele and JK ❤. Always.”

Swift is currently playing a string of dates in London as part of her reputation stadium world tour. As is her custom, the pop star has already invited a plethora of celebrities to the stage. English singer Robbie Williams and former One Direction member Niall Horan were among those to pop up at the London dates, while bestie Selena Gomez and Shawn Mendes have made appearances back stateside.

Take a look at all the stars to be welcomed to Swift’s stage here.
