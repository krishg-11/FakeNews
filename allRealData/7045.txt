Lea Michele Reduced To An Emotional Puddle Upon Meeting Icon Celine Dion — Pic

Aww! Lea Michele broke down in tears when she met her icon, Celine Dion, backstage at the Billboard Music Awards on May 21. Lea was lucky enough to introduce Celine before her performance of ‘My Heart Will Go On,’ but Lea had more fun embracing the singer backstage! See the pics here.

Lea Michele was one lucky lady on May 21, when she not only got to introduce her icon, Celine Dion, before the singer performed “My Heart Will Go On,” but she also got a chance to meet and embrace Celine backstage afterwards. “My heart,” “No words,” and “I love her,” are three different captions Lea used when she posted pictures of their special interaction, during which Lea broke down in tears and became a blubbering mess.

Before that interaction, however, Lea took the stage at the BBMAs and introduced her icon with the following speech: “2017 marks the 20th anniversary of one of the most honored films in Academy Awards history — Titanic. The movie’s theme song, “My Heart Will Go On,” went to number one around the world and became one of the biggest selling singles of all time. The song is iconic, so it’s only fitting that it be performed tonight by a global superstar, a woman who made it her signature song. And on a personal note, she is a woman who has always inspired me, and inspires countless others with her poise, her dignity, and her strength, and of course, her incredible talent. It’s a true honor for me to introduce her. Ladies and gentlemen, Celine Dion!”

And before the show, she told E! News that she’d freak if she got close to Celine. “I’m afraid they’re going to kick me out,” she joked. “I mean, I really am obsessed with her. I think she’s incredible. Just to be in the same building with her today is going to be awesome for me.”
