The woman at the center of the alleged Kevin Hart cheating scandal denies being an extortionist

LOS ANGELES (AP) — A woman has come forward to say she was involved with Kevin Hart a month ago but she is not an extortionist.

Montia Sabbag at a press conference called to discuss Kevin Hart extortion scandal Frederick M. Brown / Stringer LOS ANGELES (AP) — A woman has come forward to say she was involved with Kevin Hart a month ago but she is not an extortionist.

Montia Sabbag (mahn-tee-uh suh-bahg) spoke to reporters at her lawyer's Los Angeles office Wednesday following Hart's weekend apology to his pregnant wife and children via an Instagram video for what he called an error in judgment.

He also said someone was trying to seek financial gain from his mistake and he'd rather confess than let that happen.

Sabbag says that since her involvement with Hart, her name and pictures have become public and lies have been written about her.

She says she's a recording artist and actress, and hasn't broken any laws.

Sabbag also mentioned unspecified recordings but says she had nothing to do with them.
