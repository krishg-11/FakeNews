Bobbi Kristina was found face down in a bathtub in her Georgia home on Jan. 31, 2015, nearly 3 years after the death of her mother, Whitney Houston. After spending nearly six months in a coma, Bobbi Kristina died in hospice care on July 26, 2015, at the age of 22.

During an interview with pastor T.D. Jakes last September, Brown said he wouldn't "get closure" after losing his daughter until her boyfriend, Nick Gordon, was criminally charged for her death.

Gordon was found liable for the wrongful death of Bobbi Kristina last September when he was a no-show at the hearing on the civil lawsuit filed against him by the state. One month later, he was ordered to pay $36 million.
