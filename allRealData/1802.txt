Will.i.am totally stole this idea from us, we've been thinking for a long time that earnest people reacting to a candidate is the future of music video.

The work that we face in our time is great

in a time of war

and the terrible sacrifices it entails

the promise of a better future is not always clear

there's gonna be other wars

I'm sorry to tell you there's gonna be other wars

there's gonna be a lot of combat wounds

and my friends it's gonna be tough

and we're gonna have a lot to do

That old Beach Boys song, Bomb Iran?

Bomb Bomb Bomb, Bomb...

I'm still convinced that withdrawal means chaos

and if you think that things are bad now

if we withdraw--you ain't seen nothing yet

was the war a good idea, worth the price in blood and treasure?

It was a good idea

President Bush talked about our staying in Iraq for 50 years

Maybe a hundred, that's fine with me

I don't think Americans are concerned if we're there for a hundred years, or a thousand years, or ten thousand years.
