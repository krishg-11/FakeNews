TLC cut ties with Derick Dillard, Jill Duggarâ€™s husband, over transphobic comments about Jazz Jennings

"Derick I understand that you may think your way is the highway, but I'll go ahead and say it outright: you are a hateful person. I mean it from the bottom of my heart," one person responded to Dillard. "You have absolutely no respect for anyone that is not just like you."
