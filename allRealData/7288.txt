Eva Longoria Wants A Desperate Housewives Revival

Eva Longoria was speaking with NewBeauty when she said those encouraging words, though she did counteract them by reminding everyone that Marc Cherry has consistently affirmed his stance that he doesn't want to do more Desperate Housewives beyond the eight seasons that aired. But we all know that nothing is set in stone when it comes to TV, so maybe once we get a little further away from the series' 2012 finale, Cherry might arrive at a revival idea that he can't put out of his head. And thankfully, the Desperate Housewives finale didn't kill everyone off in a jaw-dropping fashion, so there wouldn't be any need to retcon story points.
