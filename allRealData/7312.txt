(Photo by Steve Granitz/WireImage) Mark Townsend explains how he created Gal's slick-back look. “Gal is wearing an amazing metallic PRADA gown for Critics’ Choice this evening! I kept referring to her dress as the “dazzling Grecian goddess,” because it has a super modern cut to it with a bit of a drop waist and a deep neckline that nods to the 70s. To play into the structure of the gown, we aimed to create the ultimate statuesque silhouette from head to toe. For hair, we decided on a super sleek style pulled away from her face with exceptional shine." 1. To start, I prepped hair with Dove Smooth & Shine Heat Protection Spray ($4.99) and blew it straight with a Mason Pearson brush to ensure it was bend free. 2. Once strands were fully dry, I flat ironed 2-inch sections of hair with my Harry Josh Pro Tools Ceramic Flatiron ($200) for pin straight strands. 3. Next, I created a deep side part, and combed Oribe Rock Hard Gel ($42) through the sides to keep them slicked back and in place without using any pins. 4. While the gel dried, I ran Honest Beauty Shine Serum ($20) from mid-length to ends for extra sheen. 5. As always, I finished the look with a very liberal spray of Dove Compressed Micro Mist Extra Hold Hairspray ($4.99). Because this look was pin free, it was super important that we sprayed a ton of this to ensure the look held all night.

(Photo by Steve Granitz/WireImage) Celebrity stylist Bryce Scarlett explained his inspiration for Margot's hair. “The whole look was inspired by the fact that Margot was wearing Chanel and for hair and makeup we were trying to emulate a classic Chanel aesthetic," he explained. Get the look at home with these simple steps! 1. Prep damp hair by coating hair with the TRESemmé Repair & Protect 7 Pre-Styling Spray to protect hair from damage caused by hot tools and styling. 2. Apply TRESemmé TRES Two Extra Hold Mousse to roots while hair is still damp to create lift and volume. 3. Blow dry hair rough with hands lifting hair at the roots and directing the air up to create a ton of volume and natural wave. 4. Once completely dry, scrunch the mid-lengths to the ends of hair with water to infuse moisture and regain some of that natural wave. Then diffuse entire head of hair to add more natural texture and wave until dry. 5. Spray the NEW TRESemmé Compressed Micro-Mist Hair Spray Hold Level 2: Smooth all over the head, tousling the hair and lifting from the roots to provide grittiness and texture without stiffness. 6. Pull the hair up into a ponytail slightly to the left side of the top of the head with an elastic letting some pieces fall out around the nape of the neck. Twist hair around to create a nice undone know and secure with bobby pins. 7. Tie a black velvet ribbon around the bun into a bow and pin into place. 8. Pull little wisps of hair out around the hair line for added detail and spray the NEW TRESemmé Compressed Micro-Mist Hair Spray Hold Level 2: Smooth all over to lock the look into place. SANTA MONICA, CA - JANUARY 11: Actor/director Greta Gerwig attends The 23rd Annual Critics' Choice Awards at Barker Hangar on January 11, 2018 in Santa Monica, California. (Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images) Stylist John D. explained the message he tried to evoke with her hair. "Greta wore a gorgeous white Fendi gown with a beaded heart detail on the chest. The dress had a very Grecian/ethereal inspiration to it. Greta wanted the hair to feel like it was pulled up off her neck kind of like an updo," he explained. Here's how he mastered the look. 1. Prep hair using a dollop ofTRESemmé TRES Two Extra Hold Mousse emulsified between fingertips and applied right at the roots. I applied this all over the entire head because the hair was super clean and needed a little extra grip. 2. Blow dry hair using hands and a round brush. Dry hair in the opposite direction from where it lays to create loads of volume. I used the round brush on the top of the head where the hair was longer and I wanted to see a more polished look. I then used my hands to dry the rest of the hair throughout. 3. Section out the top horseshoe section and clip to the side. Then backcomb the sides and the back of the head. Spritz the NEW Tresemme Micro-Mist Hair Spray Hold Level 1: Texturethroughout the sides and back to build texture and hold the backcombing in place. The Micro-Mist creates flexible hold that isn’t stiff or sticky making the hair really easy to work with. 4. Next, smooth and twist the sides working from front to back and lock into place with a few bobby and hair pins. 5. Release the top section and run blow-drier through it to loosen. Backcomb a bit for shape before raking hands through hair to find desired volume and shape in the front. Brush the style back to blend the look together. 6. To finish off the look, add a bent gold hair clip just at the nape of the neck before spraying the style generously with the NEW TRESemmé Compressed Micro-Mist Hair Spray Hold Level 4: Extend all over to secure the style in place with a soft flexible hold. SANTA MONICA, CA - JANUARY 11: Actor Allison Williams attends The 23rd Annual Critics' Choice Awards at Barker Hangar on January 11, 2018 in Santa Monica, California. (Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images) Stylist Peter Lux said, “The modern length of Allison’s hair gives this look a current and modern feel. I wanted to retain an understated elegance by keeping a small silhouette to the head and achieving maximum gloss to accentuate the romantic yet slightly sculptural characteristics of Allison’s dress.” Here's how: 1. To achieve this look, I first applied Dove Style+Care Smooth & Shine Heat Protection Spray ($4.99) to her damp hair and then blow dried her hair with a natural bristle brush for a smooth finish. 2. Once her hair was dry, I sprayed Dove Style+Care Compressed Micro Mist Extra Hold Hairspray ($4.99) to the root area at the sides of her hair to create a healthy gloss that locked-in the narrow shape we wanted to create. 3. Then, I used Dove Absolute Curls Supreme Crème Serum ($5.99) to add separation around the front of her hair, while also adding shine to the loose hair down her back. 4. Finally, I applied a layer of Dove Style+Care Compressed Micro Mist Extra Hold Hairspray ($4.99) to hold the look in place so that it would last all night.” SANTA MONICA, CA - JANUARY 11: Reese Witherspoon arrives at the The 23rd Annual Critics' Choice Awards at Barker Hangar on January 11, 2018 in Santa Monica, California.

(Photo by Taylor Hill/Getty Images) Said stylist Ryan Richman, "We wanted to create a modern but achievable Audrey Hepburn look. So, I pulled the hair back into a low bun and created fishtail braids for texture." Here's how: 1. Wash hair withSuave Professionals Rose Oil Infusion Volumizing Shampoo for subtle volume and protection from humidity. 2. Dry using Aquis Lisse Luxe Hair Towel to dry hair quickly with less frizz and breakage. 3. Prep damp hair with Suave Professionals Natural Volume Mousse focusing on the ends where the hair is driest. Work the remaining product up through the rest of the hair to add shine. 4. Using the Harry Josh Pro Tools Ultra Light Pro Dryer and a round brush, I blow-dried hair with a side part until smooth and dry. Then, I pulled it back into a low ponytail and secured with an elastic. 5. This is the fun part! I split the ponytail into two equal parts and created fishtail braids. I sprayed Suave Professionals Natural Hold Micro Mist Hairspray as I braided to give hair a flexible hold with no sticky residue. 6. Last, I secured the braids with elastics and used hair pins to secure a low bun.” Actress Octavia Spencer arrives for the 23rd annual Critics' Choice Awards at the Barker Hangar on January 11, 2018, in Santa Monica, California. / AFP PHOTO / JEAN-BAPTISTE LACROIX (Photo credit should read JEAN-BAPTISTE LACROIX/AFP/Getty Images) SANTA MONICA, CA - JANUARY 11: Actor Alison Brie attends The 23rd Annual Critics' Choice Awards at Barker Hangar on January 11, 2018 in Santa Monica, California.
