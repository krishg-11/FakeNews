How Contestants On The Bachelor Keep Their Hair Looking SO Good

But unlike many people who cocktail a few products, King relies on one: Tresemme Curl Hydration conditioner. "It's not a 'leave-in' conditioner, but I don't really know the difference in what makes a 'leave-in' conditioner OK to leave in and regular conditioner not," she says. "I wet my hair, add a palm full of conditioner, comb out any knots, and let it air dry. Letting my hair dry in the sun gives me the best results."King also points out that, despite the rumors, sometimes the production crew does bring in reinforcements. “One night, one we did get some help from hairstylist and makeup artists. The hairstylists used this super tiny curling iron on my hair; it was the same exact size as my own curls. She used it on my stubborn strands that are too lazy to curl along with the rest. It was great! I have yet to go out and buy one, but it's on my list,” she says.Curl Hydration Flawless Conditioner, $4.79, available at
