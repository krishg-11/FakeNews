Kim Kardashian Doesn't Want Kendall Jenner To Get A Gun: "I Wouldn't Want My Kids Around It"

The Kardashians want to protect themselves. In response to being stalked, Kendall Jenner is looking to buy a gun to defend herself. In a new clip from Keeping Up With the Kardashians, the model and sister Khloe Kardashian try to explain to Kim Kardashian why they want to carry guns.

"Kendall and I were talking earlier and she just feels really unsafe. She says she has literally a different stalker outside of her house every few days. She's a single girl who lives alone, like someone's already broken into her home, what if she was there?" Khloe says.

Kim, who is the mother to two (and soon three) small children, isn't an advocate of guns in the home. "Well, that's what you have security for," she says in the preview. "I'm not comfortable with it. I wouldn't want my kids around it. I wouldn't want sleepovers going on here, with the kids here and I know there's a gun."

Despite her own experience being violently robbed in Paris, Kim insists that she wouldn't want to carry a gun. When asked if being armed that night would have saved her, Kim insists that she was outnumbered. "I would not shoot these, it was three against one, or six, you know, or seven, I didn't know about. There was no way I was gonna get out of there, I'm not like, Laura Croft."

Last year, Kendall was stalked by a man and she testified against him in court. "This is not how I want to be living...I really don't feel safe in my own house...I'm already the kind of person who's on edge," she said while on the stand. Her stalker was arrested in August after she found him waiting in her driveway in the Hollywood Hills.
