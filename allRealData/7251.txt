Serena Williams Shows Stunning Wedding Ring in Cute Pic of Baby Alexis

Serena Williams shared a gorgeous photo of her baby Alexis which also shows her beautiful wedding ring!

A new photo posted by the famous tennis player on Instagram shows 2-month-old Alexis Olympia, her daughter with Alexis Ohanian, dressed in a leopard-print romper with a towel in the same print underneath her. The picture caption reads, “Daddy knows how much I love leopard print.”

What she doesn’t mention but we noticed immediately is a massive diamond ring! Serena and Alexis got married last week in a Beauty and the Beast-themed wedding in New Orleans, with a guest list that included Venus Williams, Beyonce, Eva Longoria, Kim Kardashian, and more celebrities and friends.
