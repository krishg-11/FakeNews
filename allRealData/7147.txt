Amber Portwood 'ready' to rekindle Farrah Abraham friendship

Aug. 31 (UPI) -- Amber Portwood says she's "ready" to be friends with Farrah Abraham again.

The 27-year-old television personality said Wednesday in an interview with E! News that she wants to end her feud with her 26-year-old Teen Mom OG co-star.

"[Farrah] has a very strong mind and strong opinions. So do I. So I think it's natural for us to clash," Portwood explained. "Plus, she's crazy. We used to be friends, but I don't know what happened. I think she did things for publicity."

"I still love her to death. She knows that," she qualified. "I'm ready to just let everything go. With her, it's on her terms, so I'm not really putting any effort into it or thinking about it."

The Teen Mom stars' recent conflicts include Abraham sending Portwood a cease-and-desist letter for "making false and defamatory statements about Ms. Abraham to the media," according to People. The pair also got in a physical altercation in October while filming the Season 6 reunion special.

Portwood confirmed Oct. 23 that she and her fiancé, Matt Baier, confronted Abraham and her dad, Michael Abraham, after Abraham and her then-boyfriend, Simon Saran, said Baier looked like a "pedophile."

"Matt went out there to get me not fight ... her dad got in my face so Matt got in the middle and Michael choked him so Matt knocked him on his [expletive]," she tweeted. "While Simon sat on the couch the whole time lol."

Portwood and Abraham came to fame on the MTV series 16 & Pregnant, before starring on Teen Mom. Portwood shares 8-year-old daughter Leah with ex-fiancé Gary Shirley, while Abraham is mom to 8-year-old daughter Sophia.
