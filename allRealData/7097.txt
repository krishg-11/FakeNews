Here's a Shirtless Photo of Idris Elba to Get You Through the Week

Idris Elba is making his directorial debut behind the scenes for his new film Yardie, but still proves to be a natural in front of the camera.

The 44-year-old actor strips down for Essence's Global Issue, teasing a slightly unbuttoned shirt on the cover. Dig a little deeper into the issue and you've hit another jackpotâ€”a photo of Elba as he shows off his perfectly sculpted figure in jeans, a peek of his Topman briefs and not much else. Bless!

While in Thailand training for a professional kickboxing tournament, Elba talks to the magazine about work, love and fatherhood.
