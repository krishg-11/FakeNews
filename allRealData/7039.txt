Iggy Azalea Is "Obsessed" with One Particular Photo in Paris Hilton's Home

The rapper dished all about her recent girls' night with the socialite on #WWHL.

Remember that time Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, Bella Thorne, and Iggy Azalea all had a girls' night at Paris Hilton's abode? Well, we do. And since we didn't get an invite, Iggy spilled all about that fabulous evening during Sunday's Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen. It was there that she revealed some of the secrets of Paris' house.

"It's just like all fabulous pictures of Paris Hilton. My favorite, like the best thing in her house, I promise she has this gigantic — well there's a lot of pictures of herself, which I love [and] there should be — but the best picture of herself is this giant picture of Paris Hilton and she's wearing a Guess shirt and it says, 'Can you afford me?'" Iggy shared.

So, where does Paris hang this important PSA? "And I was like, 'I love it. I'm obsessed.' It's so amazing and it's right when you walk into bedroom," Iggy shared. "And I'm like, 'Yes, Paris you need to give that message before you bring a guy back into your bedroom. He should ask himself the question: 'Can you afford me?'"

FYI, expect more intel in the future since Iggy hinted, "I'm having another [girls' night] soon."
