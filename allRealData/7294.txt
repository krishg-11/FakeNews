Naya Rivera and Ryan Dorsey Agree on Joint-Custody of Son Josey

Naya Rivera and Ryan Dorsey are working things out.

The Glee star and her estranged husband reached a custody agreement in regards to their 2-year-old son, Josey, according to court documents obtained by ET.

In papers filed on Dec. 22, the couple has agreed to share 50/50 joint custody and shall consult one another on all major decision relating to their son's health, education and welfare. The documents also state that they will equally divide all holidays and vacations with their son.

The custody agreement comes after Rivera, 30, refiled for divorce earlier this month after filing to dismiss the order in October. She had originally filed for divorce in Nov. 2016, two years after they tied the knot.

Things between Rivera and Dorsey, 34, began to go south again after the actress was arrested in Kanawha County, West Virginia, on Nov. 25 and charged with domestic battery against her husband. According to a spokesperson for the Kanawha County Sheriffâ€™s Office, the two were arguing over their child.

Following her arrest, Dorsey took to social media to ask both fans and media to respect his and Rivera's privacy.

Hear what he had to say in the video below.
