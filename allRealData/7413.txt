Channing Tatum Spotted Without Wedding Ring for First Time Since Jenna Dewan Split -- See the Pic!

Looks like Channing Tatum has ditched his wedding ring.

After separating from Jenna Dewan Tatum earlier this month after eight years of marriage, the 37-year-old actor was spotted out and about in London, England, on Thursday, ringless.

Channing was seemingly trying to keep a low profile after hopping off a flight at Heathrow Airport, clad in a white Harvard Business School hoodie with maroon lettering. He shaded his face with a black baseball cap and appeared to be on the phone.

One day earlier, Jenna -- who was photographed without her ring two weekends ago in Los Angeles -- shared a sexy, lingerie-clad pic to Instagram. The snap garnered over 212,000 likes, including one from Channing!

"A little R&R in my favorite @danskinapparel intimates," Jenna captioned it.

The professional dancer, also 37, shared an equally seductive shot to her Instagram Stories, accompanied with four pink heart emojis.

As for the couple's actual separation, multiple sources have told ET that it was a long time coming.

"They have been fighting the last couple of years -- quite a bit," one source claimed. "There is a sense of relief on both of their parts. They have tried working on things and had therapy, but nothing changed."
