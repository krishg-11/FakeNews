Jay Cutler Says He Picks Out "98 Percent" Of Kristin Cavallari's Outfits

It seems as though Kanye West isn't the only Hollywood husband to pick out his wife's outfits. Kim Kardashian previously revealed that when her and Kanye first got serious, he told her that she had horrible style. "I wanted to learn. I wasnâ€™t offended when he said that. When he did that he wanted to teach me," she said.

Former American quarterback Jay Cutler seems to be doing the same thing for his wife Kristin Cavallari. A new clip from their reality show Very Cavalarri, shows the couple in Kristin's grand closet picking an outfit to go to a photo shoot. She looks to her man for assistance where he makes his choice and realizes it's not something new.

"You know what though, I think I pick out 98 percent of your clothes," Jay says in the video below. "Do people know that I style you?" Kristin just replies: "It's just easier if you're standing there." Jay then has to help his wife put on her sweater since she doesn't want to mess up her hair. "I have to pick out your clothes, I have to dress you," he jokes.

Check it out and catch the Very Cavallari premiere this Sunday July 8th at 10 p.m., on E! if you care to watch more.
