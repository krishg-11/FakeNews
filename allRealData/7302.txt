Oscars: Gary Oldman Wins Best Actor for 'Darkest Hour'

It was the first win and second nomination for the actor.

Gary Oldman won the Academy Award for best actor on Sunday night.

The Darkest Hour star beat out Timothee Chalamet (Call Me by Your Name), Daniel Day-Lewis (Phantom Thread), Daniel Kaluuya (Get Out) and Denzel Washington (Roman J. Israel, Esq.).

The award capped off a season of other honors for Oldman at shows such as the Critics' Choice, Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild and BAFTA Awards. It was the first Oscar win for the actor. He was previously nominated for best actor for 2011's Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.

In Darkest Hour, Oldman portrays revered U.K. Prime Minister Winston Churchill in the early days of World War II. The actor praised Churchill as he accepted his award, saying, "I would just like to salute Sir Winston Churchill, who has been marvelous company on what can be described as an incredible journey."

Oldman concluded by thanking his mother, "who is older than the Oscar, she is 99 years young, next birthday. And she's watching the ceremony from the comfort of her sofa. I say to my mother, 'Thank you for your love and support. Put the kettle on. I’m bringing an Oscar home.'"

Backstage, Oldman said that his Darkest Hour role held "special significance" for him. "I can’t say what it would be like to win an Oscar in any other year, but to win it for playing Winston makes it doubly special. It’s been an unforgettable experience."

When asked what Churchill would say to today's political leaders, Oldman replied: "He would probably give them a good talking to."

The Oscars were handed out Sunday at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywoood. Jimmy Kimmel returned as host.
