Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee React to Zero Grammy Wins for 'Despacito'

Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee nabbed big nominations at Sunday’s 60th Annual Grammy Awards with their record-breaking hit “Despacito.” The track got nods in the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance, Record of the Year and Song of the Year categories and if it had won in the either of the latter two categories, it would’ve made history as the first Spanish-language song to do so. With Bruno Mars sweeping the major categories, Fonsi and Yankee weren’t able to make that historic stride forward, but the Puerto Rican artists remained positive.

“We’re not leaving empty-handed tonight,” wrote Fonsi on Instagram following the award show. “To be able to break the language barrier and unite the world with a song is the best prize anyone can win. Let’s continue sharing our culture and our Latin music with the entire world. Thanks for supporting us, this is just the beginning.”

Yankee shared the same image, writing, “Thanks to all #latinos for coming together to see us shine at the #grammys.”

For Fonsi, the Grammy nod — and potential win — was all about celebrating his Latin heritage and pride. Before the ceremony, he spoke to ET about what the evening meant to him. “This is really big,” he said. “Not only for me, but for Latin music in general, to be able to sing a song in Spanish for the big show. I’m really proud to be here. Being from Puerto Rico, growing up here in the United States, I’ve always been so proud of my roots and my language, and all these artists who are performing, they’ve all influenced me. So to be able to celebrate a little bit of who I am and where I’m from, and to share with the world, and break that language barrier — especially after everything that [Puerto Rico has] been going through.”

Although the two artists kept their post-Grammy messages positive, some celebs and fans felt the duo were robbed, including Perez Hilton and Frankie Grande, the brother of pop star Ariana Grande.

They didn’t walk away with a trophy, but Fonsi and Yankee gave a rousing performance of “Despacito” that brought the crowd, including Chrissy Teigen and John Legend, to their feet and won a standing ovation from the audience.
