Every Single Kardashian Christmas Card — From The '80S 'Til Rn

The family has been making and sharing Christmas cards since the late '80s, and with each and every year we're presented with a new side of the family - with the only major running theme being that things get more and more glam as each Christmas comes around.

The Kardashian family has never done anything half-arsed. Whether it's selfies, massive beauty empires or sex tapes, they really do go all in. And one Kardashian commitment that we are so, so glad they have stuck to is their lavish annual Christmas card.

With Christmas fast approaching, we are all ready and waiting for the family to drop this year's card. Rumours have already been circling as to who will be in it will Scott be cut out again? Will Tristan be in it?), but the main one that has us HYPED is that potentially both Khloé and Kylie will debut their baby bumps.

Think about it, they have already premiered their 10th season of Keeping Up With The Kardashians so they won't be announcing it in that, and Kylie has been coy for so long, practically fuelling the rumour mill, so they must be waiting on a big public debut. So what better way than a shoot they can keep super private and have total control over? CUE CHRISTMAS CARD BABY ANNOUCMENT.

But before we get too excited about this year's pic, let's take a trip down memory lane and look back at every every single one of the Kardashian family's Christmas cards.
