ABC/Craig SjodinJennifer Hudson won her second Grammy this year for her performance in Broadway's The Color Purple, but was unable to collect her award at the ceremony.

So, charitable host Ellen DeGeneres decided to bring the trophy to J-Hud personally during their sit-down chat on Ellen's talk show Wednesday.

Looking visibly shocked and moved by Ellen's grand gesture, Jennifer replied, "Oh my God! Thank you!"

She also gave a brief acceptance speech, noting that her first Grammy award was given to her by Whitney Houston and her second by DeGeneres.

Jennifer, along with The Color Purple's principal cast, won a Grammy this year in the category of Best Musical Theater album. Jennifer portrayed nightclub performer Shug Avery in the musical last year. She was later replaced by Heather Headley.
