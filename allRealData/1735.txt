CHIP Enrollment: June 2011 Data Snapshot

This data snapshot provides the latest data on Childrenâ€™s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) enrollment and policy trends nationally and across the states through June 2011, based on survey responses and data provided by CHIP directors in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The report finds that in June 2011, the number of children enrolled in CHIP reached 5.3 million. From June 2010 to June 2011, an additional 178,000 children enrolled in CHIP programs across the country, a rate of growth (3.5 percent) similar to the prior annual period (3.3 percent). While enrollment continues to grow, enrollment growth in the program appears to have moderated since the start of the recession.
