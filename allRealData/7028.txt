Reception [ edit ]

Time magazine said, "Life of Kylie is meant to show us the person behind the pout. Yet Jenner combines the self-obsession of a teenager with the reflexive crouch of someone who has learned to quash confessional impulses."[8] Sadie Gennis of TV Guide commented that the show "is like its star: searching for purpose, but mostly very, very sad."[9]
