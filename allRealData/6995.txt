25 Easter Eggs You'll Want to Find Inside Disney's New 'Guardians of the Galaxy' Ride

You’re bound to expect frightening drops, chaotic thrills and laughs on behalf of Rocket Raccoon from the new “Guardians of the Galaxy” attraction at Disneyland, but trust that your wait in line will be anything but boring. The ride building, which serves as the fortress of Taneleer “The Collector” Tivan, is bursting with vintage Disney props and Marvel weaponry, including some that may be in films that aren’t even out yet.

Though the attraction exists in its own “universe,” separate from the comics and films, there are intriguing Marvel items throughout the Fortress, like Kree artifacts, the Warlock’s Eye and an audio-animatronic Cosmo test dog. Yet, it’s further into the queue where things get interesting. Tivan’s two offices and the gantry lift deck are packed with so many secret Marvel Easter eggs that — unless you’re seeking them out in the dimly lit rooms — you’d never know they exist.

There aren’t just delights for comic book aficionado. Plenty of odes to vintage Disneyland rides, including its predecessor the Tower of Terror, are tucked inside, too. As the story goes, Tivan likes to collect items from across the galaxy — which includes Disney parks, of course — and secret nods to older attractions and characters is also a Disney tradition.

We’re certain we didn’t find them all of the hidden gems and unbelievable surprises within Tivan’s collection but we did find quite a few — enough to send you back through the ride a few times over.
