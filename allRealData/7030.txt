Goldie Hawn Shocks Amy Schumer, Ellen DeGeneres During ‘Never Have I Ever’ Game (Video)

Amy Schumer and Goldie Hawn played a round of “Never Have I Ever” with Ellen DeGeneres on Thursday, and Hawn surprisingly won the round with the most “I have” revelations.

The on-screen mother-daughter duo stopped by to promote their upcoming film, “Snatched.” DeGeneres first asked them, “Never have I ever taken a naked selfie,” to which both actresses raised the “I have” paddle. But Hawn soon revealed it was actually her partner Kurt Russell who took the photo of her naked as she was pretending she “was a strong man.”

DeGeneres also asked about whether they had a tattoo that they regret, something Schumer has been vocal about in the past — she even wrote a book titled “The Girl With the Lower Back Tattoo.”

The big shocker came when DeGeneres asked, “Never have I ever been caught by the police having sex,” to which Hawn revealed that she had. But once again, it was Russell’s fault.

“Do I win?” Hawn asked, to which Schumer responded, “you’re winning!”

“Snatched” stars Hawn and Schumer as a mother and daughter who go on vacation to Ecuador but soon get kidnapped and the pair have to find a way out of their unexpected situation. Ike Barinholtz, Wanda Sykes and Joan Cusack also star.
