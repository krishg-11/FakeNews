Together Again! Every Photo of Meghan, Kate, Harry and William at Centenary of Armistice Service

The foursomeâ€™s public reunion, their first joint appearance since the 100th Anniversary of the Royal Air Force celebration in July, actually came on Saturday, when they gathered with other members of the royal family for the Festival of Remembrance Service at Royal Albert Hall. However, they entered separately and sat on opposite ends of each other for the commemoration.
