And some more chatty sources told E! that the two rang in the year by the ocean with friends. "Justin flew in to Cabo on a private jet from Cancun where he spent a few days with his family," one source told the outlet. "He arrived on Saturday evening and checked into an oceanfront villa 10 minutes away from Selena's villa where she was staying."

On New Year's Eve night, Gomez's friends reportedly had a dinner party with a mariachi band that Bieber came to. "He and Selena spent time together again. They were very low-key and dressed casually," the source continued. "They rang in the New Year together and enjoyed watching fireworks over the ocean."

Per a second source, "Justin had a great New Year's Eve with Selena. He is looking forward to 2018 with her. It was a special evening shared with a few close friends in a beautiful place."
