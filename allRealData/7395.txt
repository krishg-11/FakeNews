Pregnant Khloe Kardashian Shows Off Bare Baby Bump in Lingerie

Hot mama! Khloe Kardashian is baring it all as she nears the end of her pregnancy.

The 33-year-old reality star, who is expecting her first child with boyfriend Tristan Thompson, rocked black lingerie and cradled her bare baby bump in a new pic posted to Instagram on Wednesday, March 21.

“📸 @sashasamsonova,” she captioned the shot, tagging her glam squad.

While it’s unclear exactly when the photo was taken, Kardashian revealed on January 2 that she was officially six months along. While she traveled to Japan at eight months pregnant late last month, a source exclusively told Us Weekly that the Revenge Body host is set to stay in Cleveland until she gives birth. (Thompson, 27, currently plays for the Cleveland Cavaliers).

The Good American Designer celebrated the imminent arrival of her daughter at a pink-themed baby shower on March 11. Guests at the party included sisters Kim Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian, Kendall Jenner, Kylie Jenner, as well as mom Kris Jenner and Real Housewives stars Kim Zolciak-Biermann and Kyle Richards.

“💕 Magical moments with the most magical women! I’ll forever be in love with YOU! 💕,” the mom-to-be captioned a picture with her family at the bash.
