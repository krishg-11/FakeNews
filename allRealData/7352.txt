Shop the Exact Products Betty Cooper Wears on Riverdale to Get That Girl-Next-Door Glow

Betty Cooper is a babe! No wonder Cole Sprouse Jughead Jones is dating her. We love actress Lili Reinhart's fearless attitude on The CW's Riverdale and her subtly glam beauty look. She's known for her bouncy ponytail, girlish flush, lush lashes, and pink pout.

To get the scoop on Betty's exact product lineup, POPSUGAR interviewed Riverdale's lead makeup artist, Erin Mackenzie.

"Betty's natural look begins with Shiseido Glow Enhancing Primer with Guerlain L'Or Radiance Primer underneath for added radiance," Mackenzie revealed. "My go-to sculpt and highlight palette is Charlotte Tilbury Filmstar Bronze and Glow, and Glossier Cloud Paint for the most beautiful natural blush out there! I adjust her eye shadow each episode, always staying within a naturally defined zone, playing with tones to match her moods. Her lashes are made perfect with Clinique mascara and our favorite lip [last] season is, without question, Josie Maran Sting Plumping Butter in Free It. All this pulled together gives us that perfect girl-next-door glow!"

She also revealed how much fun it is to work on the set. "This is the hardest-working cast I've ever met," she said. "I adore them all! Not a day goes by where laughs aren't shared in the makeup trailer. Each and every cast member has become a huge part of my world, and with all that talent surrounding me, it's hard not to be inspired by them every day."
