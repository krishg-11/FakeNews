Tyra Banks Reveals Cellulite Has Always Been an 'Insecurity'

Tyra Banks continues to get candid about cosmetic surgery.

The supermodel – and co-author (with her mother) of a new memoir, Perfect Is Boring – recently revealed she had a nose job early in her career. “I feel I have a responsibility to tell the truth,” she said.

Now, she’s opening up again.

When asked if she would have more work done, Banks told E! News: “You know, I would, if there was something to remove cellulite I would totally do it…It doesn’t exist though.”

The 44-year-old explained that she “always had cellulite” and it continues to be an “insecurity.”

“When I walked down the Victoria’s Secret runway, I always covered my butt. Always,” she said. “People used to think, ‘Oh, she’s one of the top angels. That’s why she has a long train or extra.’ No, I was covering up my cellulite. Thank you Victoria’s Secret for working with me, they knew why I was doing it.”

Ultimately, Banks is hoping to encourage a more honest conversation about looks.

“Fix it or flaunt it — I think women should be able to do both,” she recently told PEOPLE. “There is a boundary line, either you’re super natural or you live at the plastic surgeon. It’s okay to hop back and forth over that line. You want a hair weave? Fine. You want permanent eyebrows? Fine. We as women need to stop judging.”
