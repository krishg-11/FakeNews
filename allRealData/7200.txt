Julianne Hough's favorite beauty products

2/7

You know those skin-care and beauty products that you use until the very last drop? The ones that you’ve spent entire brunches/text threads/email chains telling your friends about? They’re the best of the best…so amazing that you’d never risk putting them in a piece of checked luggage. At Well+Good, we call those our Beauty VIPs (you know, Very Important Products). In this series, we ask women in wellness and the public eye what beauty products they use every single day and why—with an entire Internet of options to choose from—these items stand out.

Would it surprise you to learn that Julianne Hough swears by essentially the same beauty routine you did as a teenager? This is more or less what I discover while grilling the newly minted redhead for all the deets surrounding her forever-flawless face, which always seems to be gracing either the stage or screen.

To get that glow, the down-to-earth Hough relies heavily upon a teen-beloved skincare line (more on that below), drugstore makeup, and something my mom always nagged me about when I was younger: hydration. “Most people aren’t well hydrated, and drinking regular water isn’t enough,” she tells me from a Propel event in Los Angeles. “You really have to replenish the electrolytes you are losing—that’s my not-so-secret secret.”

This simple trick appears to be paying off in spades in terms of creating a natural glow, as Hough’s daily makeup routine is best described as minimal. “I just wear a little bit of concealer, some gel on my eyebrows, and I do a quick little contour on my cheeks,” she tells me as we talk more things makeup at a separate Fitbit event. “[For meetings], I amp it up a bit more by adding a bronze-y eyeshadow, a smudged eyeliner on the top so it’s not too perfect, and a coral-pink lip.”
