Netflix's 6 original Marvel superhero shows, ranked from worst to best

Netflix made a deal with Marvel Comics back in 2013 to produce four Marvel-universe shows and a mini-series.

The deal expanded in 2017, when Netflix released its sixth Marvel show, "The Punisher." Its latest is season three of "Daredevil," which dropped October 19.
