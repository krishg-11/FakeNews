'Game of Thrones' and 'Westworld' Are Skipping Comic-Con

Yet another major pop culture player is foregoing a San Diego Comic-Con panel this year, with HBO announcing that neither "Game of Thrones" nor "Westworld" will be present at the annual fan event.

In a statement, the premium cable outlet explained that the omission of its two biggest series from Comic-Con was a purely logistical choice, noting that "production schedules and air dates" for the splashy series conflicted with the July event.

Here are HBO's remarks in full:



"Due to production schedules and air dates for Game of Thronesand Westworld, these series will not be presented at San Diego Comic-Con this summer. HBO has a longstanding relationship with SDCC, and we are very grateful for the fans' enthusiastic response over the years. We look forward to returning in the future."



HBO has offered a "Game of Thrones" panel every year since the show's premiere. Skipping it now, ahead of the launch of the show's eighth and final season in 2019, seems more than a little anti-climactic. And while "Westworld" only made its Comic-Con debut last year, it seemed by all accounts poised for another buzzy panel in 2018, following all of its season two shakeups.

Of course, HBO isn't the only notable name that won't be presenting a panel in Hall H this year: Marvel is also passing on that noteworthy annual event, instead simply offering fans a floor exhibit honoring 10 years of the MCU. But according to Deadline, HBO won't even be doing that, skipping any sort of Comic-Con presence entirely (and that includes a rumored sneak peek at one of the potential "Thrones" spinoffs). Bummer.

Regardless of those glaring absences, Comic-Con will be overflowing with other offerings -- more information can be found here. The event runs from July 19 through July 22.
