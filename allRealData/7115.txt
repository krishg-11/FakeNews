‘Drop the Mic': James Corden Reveals Dream Rap Battle – and It’s Judi Dench Vs Maggie Smith

James Corden and Jensen Karp, executive producers on TBS’s “Drop the Mic,” shared their dream rap battle: Judi Dench vs. Maggie Smith.

The new TBS series, yet another musical spin-off of one of Corden’s “Late Late Show” bits, pits celebrities against one another in no-holds-barred rap battles in front of a live studio audience and hosts Method Man and Haley Baldwin.

The stars team up with the show’s writers and rappers to pen their verses, and the executive producers revealed who they’d most like to write for at the Television Critics Association press tour on Thursday.

“Judi Dench is my pick,” Karp said. “If I could write a rap battle for anybody, it would be Dame Judi Dench.”

“I’d like to see Judi Dench vs. Maggie Smith,” added Corden. “Dame on Dame, saying everything they’ve dreamt of saying for the last 30 years.”

“It’s our Biggie and Tupac … it only ends with murder,” Karp wryly quipped.
