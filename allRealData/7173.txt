Beyoncé and Jay-Z Have Date Night On A Yacht

When Beyoncé and Jay-Z do date night, they do it big (much like everything else the power couple does). In the latest photo upload to Beyonce.com, the singer shared pictures of the pair's PDA-filled date aboard a yacht.

The rapper plants a kiss on Queen Bey in one photo and in another blurry snapshot, the two cozy up on the floor of the yacht. For the occasion, Beyoncé wore a black and white striped bell-sleeve top, denim shorts, and Ivy Park flip flops while Jay opted for a gray hoodie and white shorts.

Along with their sweet couple photos, the two also posed for some solo shots because, as we all know, having enough Instagram content is key. Bey looked incredible while lounging in a pair of black and white sunglasses:

While the rapper lit a cigar and did a little dance for his own solo shots, as one does when aboard a yacht.

Of course, we all know Jay is a pro at staging "candid" pictures for the ultimate money shot.
