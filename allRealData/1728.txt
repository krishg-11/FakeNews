Missing Teen-Ager Found in New Jersey

A Connecticut teen-ager who was missing for six days after she took a train to New York City was reunited with her family early yesterday after the police found her at a New Jersey home where she was staying.

Melissa Gay, 14, met her parents, Robert and Lynette, at the police station in Montville, N.J., at 2:30 A.M. yesterday and returned home to Ridgefield, Conn.

We haven't really talked to her yet," Mr. Gay said yesterday from the Pierre Hotel. "We just gave her hugs and brought her home."

Mr. Gay, a partner in the private investment firm Bain Capital, launched a huge search with the help of business partners Thursday to help locate his daughter, whom the family had not heard from since last Saturday.
