Style File: Chris Pine

Back in the early Noughties Chris Pine was a clean-shaven, shaggy-haired teen romcom king (Just My Luck, anyone?). Then six years ago came Star Trek and with it a sharp haircut, two millimetres of stubble and a newfound appreciation for Ralph Lauren tailoring. Now, not only does the man dominate every red carpet he arrives on, but he's also got the whole off-duty actor look down to a tee. With Star Trek: Into Darkness in cinemas now, here we take a look at his greatest hits.
