McCain Campaigns In Nashville

NASHVILLE, Tenn. - Republican presidential candidate John McCain held a town hall meeting at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium Monday.

The Arizona senator gave a 25-minute stump speech before answering questions from the audience at the former home of the Grand Ole Opry.

Former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist and former Sen. Fred Thompson spoke before McCain addressed the crowd at the Nashville landmark.

McCain covered several topics as people rose to their feet to ask questions.

McCain said he hasn't chosen a vice presidential running mate.

"I'm the only Republican in my whole family so you can imagine what hell I get," one man told McCain as people applauded. "But I like you. I'm the only one in my family that likes you."

Laughter filled the theater.

"Maybe I could meet them sometime," McCain after chuckling.

He reportedly likes this interactive style of campaigning because it keeps him on his toes. He never skipped a beat Monday even when challenged by audience members.

McCain reiterated his support for a summer gas tax break for Americans in response to rising fuel prices. He emphasized the need for America to keep troops in Iraq. He also said the nation does not need to negotiate with Iran.

He emphasized differences between his positions and that of chief rival Illinois Sen. Barack Obama. He didn't mention New York Sen. Hillary Clinton until someone in the audience asked him about her.

The Arizona senator attended private fundraisers in Nashville. He will travel to Memphis Tuesday for a private fundraiser.
