CQ Vote Studies

Congressional Quarterly has studied the voting behavior of members of Congress since 1953 to assess how often lawmakers stick with members of their own caucus on votes when the two parties divide and how often they back the president on votes where he has a clear position. With Congress out of town until after the national conventions, CQ's editors are digging into their votes database to compile expanded vote analysis packages for CQ.com.

New! Partisanship and Presidential Support in the Bush Era

CQ has completed a study of all roll-call votes during the seven-and-a-half years of President Bush's two terms â€” up to Congress' August recess. It is a first-ever look at the way lawmakers voted over an entire presidency. It underscores the high level of Capitol Hill partisanship that has been a hallmark of the period, and shows that while Republican support for President Bush was quite high, Democratic support was almost nonexistent in the House and very limited in the Senate.

The searchable table shows both party unity and presidential support scores over the entire Bush presidency for individual lawmakers who are currently serving in the 110th Congress. It also flags the races CQ Politics has determined will be competitive on Election Day.
