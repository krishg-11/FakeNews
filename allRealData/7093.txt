Bikini-Clad Christina El Moussa and Her New Man Celebrate Fourth of July with Romantic Boat Trip

Christina El Moussa just can’t get enough of her new beau.

The reality star has been dating 55-year-old businessman Doug Spedding since splitting from her now-ex-husband, Tarek. And things seemed to be heating up between the new couple earlier this week, as they were spotted enjoying a romantic boat outing on Independence Day.

Photos of the sweet display showed El Moussa in a tiny, striped bikini as she cuddled up to Spedding, who wore a t-shirt and jeans, on the deck of her boat in Newport Beach, California.

The Flip or Flop star was all smiles during the mini-getaway as she reconnected with her former flame – El Moussa was linked to Spedding before her marriage to Tarek.

“Their children are only a few years apart, so they’ve been doing a lot of activities with the kids: ice skating, swimming, BBQs, just low-key stuff at home,” a source told PEOPLE.

“Christina respects that he is a great father; he’s always present when it comes to his children and isn’t distracted by his phone and social media,” the source added.

“They’re just taking it slow and enjoying their time together.”

El Moussa and Tarek called it quits in 2016 after seven years of marriage. However, the two have no plans to stop filming their hit series together.
