2008 Presidential Election

METHODOLOGY: The totals on these charts are calculated from PAC contributions and contributions from individuals giving more than $200, as reported to the Federal Election Commission. Individual contributions are generally categorized based on the donor's occupation/employer, although individuals may be classified instead as ideological donors if they've given more than $200 to an ideological PAC.

NOTE: All the numbers on this page are for the 2008 election cycle and based on Federal Election Commission data released on Sunday, April 15, 2007. Feel free to distribute or cite this material, but please credit the Center for Responsive Politics. (Help! The numbers don't add up...")
