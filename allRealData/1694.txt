They’re baaaaaackkk!!!

A preview of the second season of the breakout hit Jersey Shore aired prior to the MTV Movie Awards on Sunday night.

In the clip, we get to see the cast migrating south like a flock of tanned, juiced-up birds, as it’s explained how the snowy weather in the Northeast this past February brought a halt to the antics the show is based on, hence the change of scenery.

Said Pauly D: “We love Jersey, but you can’t tan in this weather, you can’t creep in this weather. I think the beaches in Miami Beach are topless — so I’m gonna be spendin’ a lot of time on the beach.”

In the clip, Snooki introduces us to her new “gorilla juicehead” boyfriend Emilio Masella, while offering political analysis on President Barack Obama’s tanning tax.

“I don’t go tanning-tanning anymore because Obama put a 10 percent tax on tanning,” Snooki complained as Masella shot her with spray tan. “He did that because of us.”

The new season of Jersey Shore, featuring the cast in both South Florida and New Jersey, premieres on MTV Thursday, July 29 at 10/9c.
