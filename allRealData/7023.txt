'Real Housewives' Star Jokingly Offers Oral Sex From Daughter to Meet John Legend, Chrissy Teigen Responds

This just in: Some people can't take a joke, even when said joke is very clearly a joke. Kim Zolciak-Biermann, current Don't Be Tardy star and former Real Housewives of Atlanta cast member, hit up Chrissy Teigen on Twitter Wednesday with a tongue-in-cheek offer of oral sex on behalf of her 20-year-old daughter Brielle in exchange for meeting John Legend at one of his shows:

@chrissyteigen sooo ur hubby is comin to ATL may19 & Kash is beyond OBSESSED w him! who does Brielle have to blow in order to meet him?? LOL â€” Kim ZolciakBiermann (@Kimzolciak) May 4, 2017

Teigen replied with a joke of her own, telling Zolciak-Biermann "it's not that good of a show" and that tickets could be acquired without the utilization of oral sex:

@Kimzolciak Plz don't blow anyone it's not that good of a show. Jk it's good but I'll get you tix without the oral â€” christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) May 4, 2017

Without fail, some attempted to criticize the joke as if oral sex were actually being used as a currency:

@chrissyteigen @Kimzolciak Disgusting as fuck! Thats her daughter..smfh #classless guess mama wants her daughter to find her a " big papa" too â€” Angelina orduna (@aorduna21) May 5, 2017

@chrissyteigen @Kimzolciak Brielle is too young for a "joke" this crass. Never in a million would I involve my daughter in a BJ joke. You're both better than this. â€” M.GreenAlwaysRight (@MZGreen05) May 4, 2017

@chrissyteigen @Kimzolciak Just a suggestion, but you know you can just go on Ticketmaster and not pimp out your daughter? â€” Caroline Feraday (@CarolineFeraday) May 4, 2017

@GrantNorgan @CarolineFeraday @chrissyteigen @Kimzolciak So it's cool for her mom to pimp her out to 'whoever she has to blow' â€” D L Sipes ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ (@ChiggySiam) May 4, 2017

@BrielleZolciak Old picture or not, what your mom did was disgusting and inappropriate. â€” Sara Elizabeth (@sarameloney) May 5, 2017

BRB. I need to take a sighing break.

For the record, Brielle is cool with the joke:

people only have a sense of humor when it benefits them â€” brielle biermann (@BrielleZolciak) May 4, 2017

And she isn't a fan of some publications' coverage methods:

i just wanna know where u found this pic of me from 5 years ago... no wonder everyone's making a big deal out of this! i look 12! https://t.co/nkgO3Q7AfY â€” brielle biermann (@BrielleZolciak) May 5, 2017

Zolciak-Biermann later told TMZ that anyone who regularly pays attention to her account would know that's simply her "sense of humor." She also had a message for those still up in arms about the tweet: "If you can't take a joke, feel free to unfollow," she said Thursday.

So let's all just shut the fuck up about it. If you don't like what a celebrity tweets, unfollow their account and go about your life as if it never happened. Deal? Great. There are more important things going on.
