Cardi B meets superfan Aidy Bryant on 'Saturday Night Live'

Saturday Night Live's Aidy Bryant is a Cardi B superfan. So when the "Bodak Yellow" star appeared as a musical guest on the show, Bryant felt inspired.

Watching "Aidy B" take no shit from her co-workers (even when there's no shit being given) is delightful. But watching her fan out in front of an increasingly concerned Cardi B is a laugh riot.
