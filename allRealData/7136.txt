Justin Theroux and Jennifer Aniston met on the set of Tropic Thunder in 2007, started dating in 2010 and got married five years later - but it could have been a very different story. The 46-year-old actor has revealed that he actually had the opportunity to audition for Friends, the sitcom that made his wife a household name, more than 20 years ago.

His reason for skipping the audition that could have changed his life? He wanted a lie in.

Theroux told Mr Porter that he "didn't bother" to turn up, admitting: "I slept in that day." He then went on to add that it was probably for the best because, had he got the gig, he "wouldn't have been prepared for [the fame]".

The actor, screenwriter and director (he co-wrote Tropic Thunder and Zoolander 2 with friend Ben Stiller) also revealed how Aniston often sense checks his jokes.

"When it's not funny, she calls me out. She says, 'That's not funny'," he said. When asked if she allows fart jokes in the house, he added: "Of course she would allow a fart joke, but I think she actually has a more refined sense of humour than to crack a fart joke. I think she's funnier than that."

He concluded by disagreeing with the notion that most men wouldn't like the idea of having a wife who was considered funnier than them.

"Why would a man be intimidated by a funny woman?" he said. "In a perfect world, a relationship is two people laughing together."
