Cameran Eubanks Takes You Inside Her Baby's Feminine and Glam Nursery

Gorgeous! That's really the only way to describe the dreamy and feminine nursery that Cameran Eubanks has put together for her daughter, who will arriving very soon.

The Southern Charm mom previewed the unborn tot's bedroom on Instagram. And, yes, she didn't leave out the side of sass in the caption: "Nursery all done. BY ME," she wrote, before spilling all of the details of where she bought all the items. And then added, "Edit yes duh I know the baby will p--- and sh-- all over the place just let me have my moment Gahhhhhhhdddd!!"

Cameran, this moment is all yours!

This is the first child for Cameran and her husband, Jason Wimberly. Their little girl is due sometime this fall. And she'll definitely have the perfect little room to call her own.

Check out photos from the parents-to-be from their 2014 wedding, below.
