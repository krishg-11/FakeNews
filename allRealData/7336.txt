Wendy Williams Slams Kim Kardashian’s “Desperate” NSFW Photos

On Tuesday’s episode of her show, Wendy Williams mocked Kim Kardashian for still posting naked photos on social media. “Kim, it’s clear Kanye has nothing for you except dribble and feeble conversation,” she declared. “It is clear that Kanye does not pay attention to you. It’s clear to me that you’re desperately trying to stay in the spotlight.” She continued, “Kanye makes money, Kim makes more, why are you still doing this? It’s not even about the mother thing, forget the mother thing, because a lot of people will say, ‘Oh, she’s a mother.’ It’s about, she doesn’t have to do that anymore. That would be like Cardi B returning to the poll on a Saturday night or something like that.
