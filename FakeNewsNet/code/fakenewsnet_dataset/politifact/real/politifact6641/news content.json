{"url": "http://www.bls.gov/ces/", "text": "The Current Employment Statistics (CES) program produces detailed industry estimates of nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings of workers on payrolls. CES National Estimates produces data for the nation, and CES State and Metro Area produces estimates for all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and about 450 metropolitan areas and divisions.\n\nEach month, CES surveys approximately 142,000 businesses and government agencies, representing approximately 689,000 individual worksites.\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment rose by 266,000 in November, and the unemployment rate was little changed at 3.5 percent. Notable job gains occurred in health care and in professional and technical services. Employment rose in manufacturing, reflecting the return of workers from a strike. | | | |\n\nArchived Tables from Employment and Earnings - Archived tables are available in PDF format.\n\nCES National Published Series \u2013 A table displaying the availability, by industry, of both seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted data\n\nCurrent Employment Statistics Contacts\n\nStaff members of the Current Employment Statistics are available Monday through Friday 8:30 AM TO 4:30 PM EASTERN TIME for your assistance.\n\nTelephone: (202) 691-6555\n\nFax: (202) 691-6641\n\nIf you have a specific CES data question, please contact us via e-mail.\n\nWritten inquiries should be directed to:\n\n\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\nDivision of Current Employment Statistics\n\nSuite 4840\n\n2 Massachusetts Avenue, NE\n\nWashington, DC 20212-0001\n\n", "images": ["http://www.bls.gov/images/icons/icon_large_one_screen.gif", "http://www.bls.gov/images/icons/icon_small_printer.gif", "http://www.bls.gov/images/layout/historical_icon.gif", "http://www.bls.gov/images/icons/facebook.png", "http://www.bls.gov/images/icons/icon_large_special_notice.gif", "http://www.bls.gov/images/icons/icon_large_ftp.gif", "http://www.bls.gov/images/icons/explainers_historical_data.gif", "http://www.bls.gov/images/icons/icon_email_subscribe_green.gif", "http://www.bls.gov/images/maps/sae_map_large.png", "http://www.bls.gov/images/icons/data_finder_icon.png", "http://www.bls.gov/images/icons/icon_large_table.gif", "https://www.bls.gov/images/bls_emblem.png", "http://www.bls.gov/images/icons/icon_small_link.gif", "http://www.bls.gov/images/icons/explainers_news_release.gif", "http://www.bls.gov/images/layout/rss.gif", "http://www.bls.gov/images/icons/linkedin.png", "http://www.bls.gov/images/icons/icon_large_multi_screen.gif", "http://www.bls.gov/images/icons/icon_large_quick_search.gif", "http://www.bls.gov/images/dol/HireVETS-Recognizing-employers-v1.png", "http://www.bls.gov/images/icons/twitter_bird_icon_white.png", "http://www.bls.gov/images/icons/twitter.png"], "top_img": "https://www.bls.gov/images/bls_emblem.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "Employment, Hours, and Earnings from the Current Employment Statistics survey (National) Home Page", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"image": "https://www.bls.gov/images/bls_emblem.png"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "agency": "BLS", "audience": "general", "subagency": "BLS: Employment and Unemployment", "program": "BLS: Employment and Unemployment: Employment, Hours, and Earnings from the Current Employment Statistics survey (National)", "subject": "Statistics: By geographical coverage: National, Statistics: By Industries, Statistics: Employment and Unemployment, Statistics: Wages and benefits: Hours and earnings", "date": "03/24/2008"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.bls.gov", "summary": ""}
