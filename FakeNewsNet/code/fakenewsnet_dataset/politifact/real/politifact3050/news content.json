No words can fill the hole left by the death of an innocent, but we do mourn for the victims\u2019 families as we express our sympathy.\n\nI agree with the sentiments shared yesterday at the beautiful Catholic mass held in honor of the victims. The mass will hopefully help begin a healing process for the families touched by this tragedy and for our country.\n\nOur exceptional nation, so vibrant with ideas and the passionate exchange and debate of ideas, is a light to the rest of the world. Congresswoman Giffords and her constituents were exercising their right to exchange ideas that day, to celebrate our Republic\u2019s core values and peacefully assemble to petition our government. It\u2019s inexcusable and incomprehensible why a single evil man took the lives of peaceful citizens that day.\n\nThere is a bittersweet irony that the strength of the American spirit shines brightest in times of tragedy. We saw that in Arizona. We saw the tenacity of those clinging to life, the compassion of those who kept the victims alive, and the heroism of those who overpowered a deranged gunman.\n\nLike many, I\u2019ve spent the past few days reflecting on what happened and praying for guidance. After this shocking tragedy, I listened at first puzzled, then with concern, and now with sadness, to the irresponsible statements from people attempting to apportion blame for this terrible event.\n\nPresident Reagan said, \u201cWe must reject the idea that every time a law\u2019s broken, society is guilty rather than the lawbreaker. It is time to restore the American precept that each individual is accountable for his actions.\u201d Acts of monstrous criminality stand on their own. They begin and end with the criminals who commit them, not collectively with all the citizens of a state, not with those who listen to talk radio, not with maps of swing districts used by both sides of the aisle, not with law-abiding citizens who respectfully exercise their First Amendment rights at campaign rallies, not with those who proudly voted in the last election.\n\nThe last election was all about taking responsibility for our country\u2019s future. President Obama and I may not agree on everything, but I know he would join me in affirming the health of our democratic process. Two years ago his party was victorious. Last November, the other party won. In both elections the will of the American people was heard, and the peaceful transition of power proved yet again the enduring strength of our Republic.\n\nVigorous and spirited public debates during elections are among our most cherished traditions. And after the election, we shake hands and get back to work, and often both sides find common ground back in D.C. and elsewhere. If you don\u2019t like a person\u2019s vision for the country, you\u2019re free to debate that vision. If you don\u2019t like their ideas, you\u2019re free to propose better ideas. But, especially within hours of a tragedy unfolding, journalists and pundits should not manufacture a blood libel that serves only to incite the very hatred and violence they purport to condemn. That is reprehensible.\n\nThere are those who claim political rhetoric is to blame for the despicable act of this deranged, apparently apolitical criminal. And they claim political debate has somehow gotten more heated just recently. But when was it less heated? Back in those \u201ccalm days\u201d when political figures literally settled their differences with dueling pistols? In an ideal world all discourse would be civil and all disagreements cordial. But our Founding Fathers knew they weren\u2019t designing a system for perfect men and women. If men and women were angels, there would be no need for government. Our Founders\u2019 genius was to design a system that helped settle the inevitable conflicts caused by our imperfect passions in civil ways. So, we must condemn violence if our Republic is to endure.\n\nAs I said while campaigning for others last March in Arizona during a very heated primary race, \u201cWe know violence isn\u2019t the answer. When we \u2018take up our arms\u2019, we\u2019re talking about our vote.\u201d Yes, our debates are full of passion, but we settle our political differences respectfully at the ballot box \u2013 as we did just two months ago, and as our Republic enables us to do again in the next election, and the next. That\u2019s who we are as Americans and how we were meant to be. Public discourse and debate isn\u2019t a sign of crisis, but of our enduring strength. It is part of why America is exceptional.\n\nNo one should be deterred from speaking up and speaking out in peaceful dissent, and we certainly must not be deterred by those who embrace evil and call it good. And we will not be stopped from celebrating the greatness of our country and our foundational freedoms by those who mock its greatness by being intolerant of differing opinion and seeking to muzzle dissent with shrill cries of imagined insults.\n\nJust days before she was shot, Congresswoman Giffords read the First Amendment on the floor of the House. It was a beautiful moment and more than simply \u201csymbolic,\u201d as some claim, to have the Constitution read by our Congress. I am confident she knew that reading our sacred charter of liberty was more than just \u201csymbolic.\u201d But less than a week after Congresswoman Giffords reaffirmed our protected freedoms, another member of Congress announced that he would propose a law that would criminalize speech he found offensive.\n\nIt is in the hour when our values are challenged that we must remain resolved to protect those values. Recall how the events of 9-11 challenged our values and we had to fight the tendency to trade our freedoms for perceived security. And so it is today.\n\nLet us honor those precious lives cut short in Tucson by praying for them and their families and by cherishing their memories. Let us pray for the full recovery of the wounded. And let us pray for our country. In times like this we need God\u2019s guidance and the peace He provides. We need strength to not let the random acts of a criminal turn us against ourselves, or weaken our solid foundation, or provide a pretext to stifle debate.\n\nAmerica must be stronger than the evil we saw displayed last week. We are better than the mindless finger-pointing we endured in the wake of the tragedy. We will come out of this stronger and more united in our desire to peacefully engage in the great debates of our time, to respectfully embrace our differences in a positive manner, and to unite in the knowledge that, though our ideas may be different, we must all strive for a better future for our country. May God bless America.\n\n- Sarah Palin", "images": ["https://scontent.fphl2-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p118x118/15940934_10154944886183588_1687778827788911684_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=F40CqnB7W2gAQmNZFrbdUPuLO_6iFk4k9KffmH6viSQmVFWQS21l-Le8A&_nc_ht=scontent.fphl2-2.fna&oh=01969b96d0455df08f5544cfa4297623&oe=5E6AAC6E", "https://scontent.fphl2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p56x56/12540980_10153896234888588_936131237342835554_n.png?_nc_cat=1&_nc_ohc=fdrla8MeLIIAQkwtmviZ9kmwTxeYcikXLFGXz9cDupQ-Bn-m2whrCe00w&_nc_ht=scontent.fphl2-1.fna&oh=2a6465110db75f2e6a059038790ef252&oe=5E89F7BD", "https://facebook.com/security/hsts-pixel.gif?c=3.2.5", "https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/yz/r/KFyVIAWzntM.ico"], "top_img": "https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/yz/r/KFyVIAWzntM.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.facebook.com/notes/sarah-palin/americas-enduring-strength/487510653434/", "title": "America's Enduring Strength", "meta_data": {"referrer": "default", "description": "Please click here to view the video of this statement.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLike millions of Americans I learned of the tragic events in Arizona on Saturday, and my heart"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.facebook.com", "summary": ""}
