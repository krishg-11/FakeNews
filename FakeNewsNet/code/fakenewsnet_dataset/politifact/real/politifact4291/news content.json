That was less than unemployment in collapsed-bubble states like California and Florida , but it was slightly higher than the unemployment rate in New York, and significantly higher than the rate in Massachusetts . By the way, one in four Texans lacks health insurance , the highest proportion in the nation, thanks largely to the state\u2019s small-government approach. Meanwhile, Massachusetts has near-universal coverage thanks to health reform very similar to the \u201cjob-killing\u201d Affordable Care Act.\n\nSo where does the notion of a Texas miracle come from? Mainly from widespread misunderstanding of the economic effects of population growth.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor this much is true about Texas: It has, for many decades, had much faster population growth than the rest of America \u2014 about twice as fast since 1990. Several factors underlie this rapid population growth: a high birth rate, immigration from Mexico , and inward migration of Americans from other states, who are attracted to Texas by its warm weather and low cost of living, low housing costs in particular.\n\nAnd just to be clear, there\u2019s nothing wrong with a low cost of living. In particular, there\u2019s a good case to be made that zoning policies in many states unnecessarily restrict the supply of housing, and that this is one area where Texas does in fact do something right.\n\nBut what does population growth have to do with job growth? Well, the high rate of population growth translates into above-average job growth through a couple of channels. Many of the people moving to Texas \u2014 retirees in search of warm winters, middle-class Mexicans in search of a safer life \u2014 bring purchasing power that leads to greater local employment. At the same time, the rapid growth in the Texas work force keeps wages low \u2014 nearly 10 percent of hourly Texan workers earn the minimum wage or less, well above the national average \u2014 and these low wages give corporations an incentive to move production to the Lone Star State.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But it needs lots of new jobs just to keep up with its rising population \u2014 and as those unemployment comparisons show, recent employment growth has fallen well short of what\u2019s needed.\n\nIf this picture doesn\u2019t look very much like the glowing portrait Texas boosters like to paint, there\u2019s a reason: the glowing portrait is false.\n\nStill, does Texas job growth point the way to faster job growth in the nation as a whole? No.\n\nWhat Texas shows is that a state offering cheap labor and, less important, weak regulation can attract jobs from other states. I believe that the appropriate response to this insight is \u201cWell, duh.\u201d The point is that arguing from this experience that depressing wages and dismantling regulation in America as a whole would create more jobs \u2014 which is, whatever Mr. Perry may say, what Perrynomics amounts to in practice \u2014 involves a fallacy of composition: every state can\u2019t lure jobs away from every other state.\n\nIn fact, at a national level lower wages would almost certainly lead to fewer jobs \u2014 because they would leave working Americans even less able to cope with the overhang of debt left behind by the housing bubble, an overhang that is at the heart of our economic problem.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo when Mr. Perry presents himself as the candidate who knows how to create jobs, don\u2019t believe him. His prescriptions for job creation would work about as well in practice as his prayer-based attempt to end Texas\u2019s crippling drought.", "images":
