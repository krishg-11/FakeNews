Their entire lives are shrouded in mystery, murder, deception and crime. They wouldn\u2019t know the truth if it bit them in the hiney. In the case of Slick Willy\u2019s secret airplane meeting with then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch, the secret was supposedly already out.\n\nNot true, says a reporter for the Baltimore Morning News, who has obtained a copy of a paperwork required by the state of Maryland intended to be a backup system to terrorism checks for private planes. In this case, the information logged showed that Loretta Lynch and one passenger made the trip that ended with the meeting in the hangar that both Clinton and Lynch say was a happenstance encounter with no substance.\n\nSo\u2026who was the passenger? With no point of origin paperwork or public flight plan needed for someone with such high clearance, the only evidence is the Maryland manifest, which says the former AG showed up to meet with Bill Clinton accompanied by Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nWhat would Paul Ryan, Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton be doing meeting in July, before the election, in a hangar outside of Baltimore? Theories are beginning to mount but the feeling is that Bill Clinton was negotiating for his wife and the DNC, while Ryan was looking out for the RNC and Lynch was the mediator. They were most likely conspiring to throw a wrench in the juggernaut that was the trump campaign. It didn\u2019t work.\n\nThe other possibility is that they made a deal for Hillary\u2019s freedom at the expense of an embarrassing national election loss. Would Hillary Clinton sacrifice the Democrat party, which is now basically defunct, for a few years of freedom before she finally gags on her own sins and dies? You bet she would.\n\nNow the question is: Did anyone do anything illegal? Ryan certainly could face an investigation into his professional ethics if nothing else. He\u2019s the Speaker of the House. He doesn\u2019t make policy, he leads the body that makes policy. Big difference.\n\nSOURCE", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170718010152im_/http://newsfeedpaper.press/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/body1-100x70.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170718010152im_/http://newsfeedpaper.press/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/161-100x70.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170718010152im_/http://newsfeedpaper.press/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ben1-100x70.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170718010152im_/http://newsfeedpaper.press/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/301-1.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170718010152im_/http://wazanews.tk/2017/07/13/breaking-someone-else-plane-secret-bill-clintonloretta-lynch-meeting-2", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170718010152im_/http://newsfeedpaper.press/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Gowdy-Comey1-100x70.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170718010152im_/http://newsfeedpaper.press/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/melania-dress1-100x70.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170718010152im_/http://newsfeedpaper.press/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/20134550_10211288095411411_1237320888_n1-324x160.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170718010152im_/http://newsfeedpaper.press/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/s98dfsf456sd4fs-100x70.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170718010152im_/http://newsfeedpaper.press/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/301-1-696x365.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170718010152im_/http://newsfeedpaper.press/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/301-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Please Enter Your Name Here"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170718010152/http://newsfeedpaper.press/2017/07/13/breaking-someone-else-plane-secret-bill-clintonloretta-lynch-meeting-2/", "title": "BREAKING: There Was Someone Else On That Plane For The Secret Bill Clinton/Loretta Lynch Meeting", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "propeller": "610c01f69363f8053ea27933fa22eeed", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170718010152im_/http://newsfeedpaper.press/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/301-1.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "BREAKING: There Was Someone Else On That Plane For The Secret Bill Clinton/Loretta Lynch Meeting - Breaking", "description": "The Clintons are good at one thing: Keeping secrets.
