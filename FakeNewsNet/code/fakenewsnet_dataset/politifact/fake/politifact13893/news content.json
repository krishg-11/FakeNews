While it may not have been her idea to ask for a $160K pension for being the Obama daughters\u2019 \u201ccaretaker,\u201d she was the one who filled out the paperwork and signed her name.\n\nThat may have been all well and good had Hillary Clinton won the election, which is surely what the Obamas expected to happen, but now that there\u2019s an honest man in the White House hiring honest people to run government departments, blatant lying, cheating, and thievery won\u2019t go unpunished.\n\nAt some point, the Obamas will have to learn that they aren\u2019t above the law. They knew Michelle\u2019s mother wouldn\u2019t be able to keep her fake pension forever, but they probably figured she\u2019d collect enough to keep her deep in cash for the rest of her life. Now she\u2019s looking at not only paying it all back but adding a huge fine and maybe even a few years in jail on top of that.\n\nMaybe the kids will pay it off out of their giant book deal.\n\nJoin The Resistance And Share This Article Now!", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170322084130im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b28e2e9ade41531c4c20ad7c90758253?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170322084130im_/http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4869d6244b1172afd5d1bb901ec75af5?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170322084130im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5f9cd60f4f6901a47210a34ef095778a?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170322084130im_/http://flashnewscorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/1.jpg-26-85x70.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170322084130im_/http://flashnewscorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/image4717910x.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170322084130im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c06d047ed39437aa257e593a64876072?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170322084130im_/http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d53b6067fc549fb75333c6ffe3ec086b?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170322084130im_/http://flashnewscorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IXWUrbg-85x70.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170322084130im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/cbab939f3f7ecef663d5641abb558540?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170322084130im_/http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4435337caca5ba83da4cd442ab4e1736?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170322084130im_/http://flashnewscorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/image4717910x-800x416.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170322084130im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5efcc028e89323fe7e5cae6c2817c31e?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170322084130im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3217a4eb9933cc4d198f05319b962e1b?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170322084130im_/http://flashnewscorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/first-dance3.jpg.size_.custom.crop_.1086x724-125x125.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170322084130im_/http://flashnewscorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HT_Pirelli_Amy_Schumer_MEM_151130_16x9_992-85x70.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170322084130im_/http://flashnewscorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Hedge-fund-manager-George-Soros-chairman-of-Soros-Fund-Management-LLC-Getty-640x480-125x125.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170322084130im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/eadb29432b6d5f50e78308afeb914dab?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170322084130im_/http://flashnewscorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/x314502dfds-125x125.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170322084130im_/http://flashnewscorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/hillcry-370x208.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170322084130im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6c7ab70d1a9155fc5edb58b309816b35?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170322084130im_/http://flashnewscorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-15-at-9.33.57-PM-85x70.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170322084130im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5d82ec597ba9f9ce29b65422e06e937b?s=60&d=mm&r=g"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170322084130im_/http://flashnewscorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/image4717910x.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170322084130/http://flashnewscorner.com/obamas-mother-law-charged-larceny-fraud/", "title": "BREAKING: Obama\u2019s Mother In Law Charged With Larceny And Fraud", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "BREAKING: Obama\u2019s Mother In Law Charged With Larceny And Fraud", "description": "Marian Robinson, Barack Obama\u2019s mother in law, has been charged with grand larceny and fraud for accepting money from the federal government under false pretenses.
