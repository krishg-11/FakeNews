A native-born family, the Bordens ran a mill in what became the town for generations before and after the American revolution. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Later, at the end of the 19th Century a wave of immigrants swelled the town\u2019s population. Immigrants, however, never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak.", "images": ["https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/12/Daniel-Goldman-Getty-200x150.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-dcxh5b8qxvs6g.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=296280873867140&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/12/DOJ-IG-Horowitz-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1157611757-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/04/GettyImages-1078707576-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/12/Paltrowdildogoopad-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/12/Jerry-Nadler-and-Nancy-Pelosi-Associated-Press-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Protest-for-Refugees-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/11/Pelosi-headache-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1-640x480.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/12/ghostbustersafterlife1-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/06/wi/afp/09/333etks-200x134.jpg", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=l2Y7o1IW1810vg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/12/Houston-Police-Chief-Art-Acevedo-gun-control-congress-219-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/12/migrant-workers-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/12/Matt-Gaetz-Getty-200x150.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17674108&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/12/pensacola-base-gate-closed-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/03/Devin-Nunes-ca-rep-adam-schiff-ca-house-intel-committee-ap-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/12/AP_09123107744-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/12/AP_16356688246448-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/12/Nancy-Pelosi-3-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/12/adam-schiff-milk-carton-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/patrick-morrisey-200x150.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ian Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://www.breitbart.com/live/state-union-fact-check-analysis-livewire/fact-check-no-falls-river-massachusetts-was-not-built-by-immigrants/", "title": "Fact-Check: No, Fall River, Massachusetts, Was Not \u2018Built by Immigrants\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Rep.
