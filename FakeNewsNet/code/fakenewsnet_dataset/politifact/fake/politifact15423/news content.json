You know who you are. Mark my word\u2026.\n\nYou\u2019re all going down. You know who you are.

An astringent search of public records is now revealing that between 2012 and 2018, Halper received a total of $1,058,161 from the Department of Defense. Why would anyone receive that kind of money from the DOJ? Especially someone like Halper?\n\nStefan Halper was the same person who invited George Papadopolous to London, where he just so happened to sit down next to that infamous Australian \u201cDiplomat\u201d (who also worked with the Clinton Foundation) \u2014 Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) May 11, 2018\n\nIn essence, Stefan Halper was the bag-man who enabled Brennan and Clapper to carry out the spying against the Trump Campaign at Obama\u2019s request \u2014 Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) May 11, 2018\n\nInterestingly enough, the most recent payment to Halper for $411,575 was made in two different installments which had a start date of September 26, 2016, only three days after a September 23 news article by Michael Isikoff was published about Trump aide Carter Page. The article used information fed to Isikoff by the fake Russian dossier creator Christopher Steele. It was later confirmed that the FBI used that article, along with the unverified Russian dossier as supporting evidence in a FISA warrant application for Page.\n\nVia 100% Fed Up:\n\n\u201cAccording to the Website USASPENDING.gov, the payments to Halper are for \u201cRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES (2012),\u201d \u201cRESEARCH AND STUDIES \u2013 THE YEAR 2030, (2014)\u201d, \u201cRUSSIA-CHINA RELATIONSHIP STUDY. (2015),\u201d and \u201cINDIA AND CHINA ECON STUDY (2016).\u201d\n\nHalper\u2019s most recent award was noted recently by Trump supporter Jacob Wohl, which piqued the interest of internet researchers who continued the analysis.\u201d\n\nStefan Halper was the same person who invited George Papadopolous to London, where he just so happened to sit down next to that infamous Australian \u201cDiplomat\u201d (who also worked with the Clinton Foundation) \u2014 Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) May 11, 2018\n\n\u201cWohl calls Stefan Halper the \u201cbag man\u201d who enabled Brennan and Clapper to carry out the spying against the Trump Campaign at Obama\u2019s request:\u201d\n\nIn essence, Stefan Halper was the bag-man who enabled Brennan and Clapper to carry out the spying against the Trump Campaign at Obama\u2019s request \u2014 Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) May 11, 2018\n\n\u201cThe second installment of Halper\u2019s 2016 DoD contract is dated July 26, 2017 in the amount of $129,280 \u2013 around three months before the FISA warrant on Carter Page was set to expire following repeated renewals signed by Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein and a federal judge.\n\nOn July 28, he emailed Page with what the Trump campaign aide describes as a \u201ccordial\u201d communication, which did not seem suspicious to him at the time.\n\nIn the email to Page, Halper asks what his plans are post-election, possibly probing for more information. \u201cIt seems attention has shifted a bit from the \u2018collusion\u2019 investigation to the \u2018 contretempts\u2019 [sic] within the White House and, how\u2013or if\u2013Mr. Scaramucci will be accommodated there,\u201d Halper wrote.\u201d\n\nHow much time has the MSM spent talking about the massive cash payments sent to Stefan Halper to spy on our President? ZERO.\n\n\u2014 Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) May 21, 2018\n\nHalper approached Page during an election-themed conference at Cambridge on July 11, 2016, six weeks before the September 26 Department of Justice payment start date. They would remain in contact for the next 14 months where they frequently met and exchanged emails.\n\nHere is the infamous article via Yahoo News:\n\n\u201cU.S. intelligence officials are seeking to determine whether an American businessman identified by Donald Trump as one of his foreign policy advisers has opened up private communications with senior Russian officials \u2014 including talks about the possible lifting of economic sanctions if the Republican nominee becomes president, according to multiple sources who have been briefed on the issue.\n\nThe activities of Trump adviser Carter Page, who has extensive business interests in Russia, have been discussed with senior members of Congress during recent briefings about suspected efforts by Moscow to influence the presidential election, the sources said. After one of those briefings, Senate minority leader Harry Reid wrote FBI Director James Comey, citing reports of meetings between a Trump adviser (a reference to Page) and \u201chigh ranking sanctioned individuals\u201d in Moscow over the summer as evidence of \u201csignificant and disturbing ties\u201d between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin that needed to be investigated by the bureau.\n\nSome of those briefed were \u201ctaken aback\u201d when they learned about Page\u2019s contacts in Moscow, viewing them as a possible back channel to the Russians that could undercut U.S. foreign policy, said a congressional source familiar with the briefings but who asked for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject. The source added that U.S. officials in the briefings indicated that intelligence reports about the adviser\u2019s talks with senior Russian officials close to President Vladimir Putin were being \u201cactively monitored and investigated.\u201d\n\nA senior U.S. law enforcement official did not dispute that characterization when asked for comment by Yahoo News. \u201cIt\u2019s on our radar screen,\u201d said the official about Page\u2019s contacts with Russian officials. \u201cIt\u2019s being looked at.\u201d\n\nPage is a former Merrill Lynch investment banker in Moscow who now runs a New York consulting firm, Global Energy Capital, located around the corner from Trump Tower, that specializes in oil and gas deals in Russia and other Central Asian countries. He declined repeated requests to comment for this story.\n\nTrump first mentioned Page\u2019s name when asked to identify his \u201cforeign policy team\u201d during an interview with the Washington Post editorial team last March. Describing him then only as a \u201cPhD,\u201d Trump named Page as among five advisers \u201cthat we are dealing with.\u201d But his precise role in the campaign remains unclear; Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks last month called him an \u201cinformal foreign adviser\u201d who \u201cdoes not speak for Mr. Trump or the campaign.\u201d Asked this week by Yahoo News, Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller said Page \u201chas no role\u201d and added: \u201cWe are not aware of any of his activities, past or present.\u201d Miller did not respond when asked why Trump had previously described Page as one of his advisers.\n\nThe questions about Page come amid mounting concerns within the U.S. intelligence community about Russian cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and state election databases in Arizona and Illinois. In a rare public talk this week, former undersecretary of defense for intelligence Mike Vickers said that the Russian cyberattacks constituted meddling in the U.S. election and were \u201cbeyond the pale.\u201d Also, this week, two senior Democrats \u2014 Sen. Dianne Feinstein, ranking minority member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Rep. Adam Schiff, ranking minority member on the House Intelligence Committee \u2014 released a joint statement that went further then what U.S. officials had publicly said about the matter.\n\n\u201cBased on briefings we have received, we have concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S. election,\u201d they said. \u201cAt the least, this effort is intended to sow doubt about the security of our election and may well be intended to influence the outcomes of the election.\u201d They added that \u201corders for the Russian intelligence agencies to conduct such actions could come only from very senior levels of the Russian government.\u201d\n\nPage came to the attention of officials at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow several years ago when he showed up in the Russian capital during several business trips and made provocative public comments critical of U.S. policy and sympathetic to Putin. \u201cHe was pretty much a brazen apologist for anything Moscow did,\u201d said one U.S. official who served in Russia at the time.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t been shy about expressing those views in the U.S. as well. Last March, shorty after he was named by Trump as one of his advisers, Page told Bloomberg News he had been an adviser to, and investor in, Gazprom, the Russian state-owned gas company. He then blamed Obama administration sanctions \u2014 imposed as a response to the Russian annexation of Crimea \u2014 for driving down the company\u2019s stock. \u201cSo many people who I know and have worked with have been so adversely affected by the sanctions policy,\u201d Page said in the interview. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of excitement in terms of the possibilities for creating a better situation.\u201d\n\nPage showed up again in Moscow in early July, just two weeks before the Republican National Convention formally nominated Trump for president, and once again criticized U.S. policy. Speaking at a commencement address for the New Economic School, an institution funded in part by major Russian oligarchs close to Putin, Page asserted that \u201cWashington and other West capitals\u201d had impeded progress in Russia \u201cthrough their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Page declined to say whether he was meeting with Russian officials during his trip, according to a Reuters report.\n\nBut U.S. officials have since received intelligence reports that during that same three-day trip, Page met with Igor Sechin, a longtime Putin associate and former Russian deputy prime minister who is now the executive chairman of Rosneft, Russian\u2019s leading oil company, a well-placed Western intelligence source tells Yahoo News. That meeting, if confirmed, is viewed as especially problematic by U.S. officials because the Treasury Department in August 2014 named Sechin to a list of Russian officials and businessmen sanctioned over Russia\u2019s \u201cillegitimate and unlawful actions in the Ukraine.\u201d (The Treasury announcement described Sechin as \u201cutterly loyal to Vladimir Putin \u2014 a key component to his current standing.\u201d At their alleged meeting, Sechin raised the issue of the lifting of sanctions with Page, the Western intelligence source said.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have also received reports that Page met with another top Putin aide while in Moscow \u2014 Igor Diveykin. A former Russian security official, Diveykin now serves as deputy chief for internal policy and is believed by U.S. officials to have responsibility for intelligence collected by Russian agencies about the U.S. election, the Western intelligence source said.\u201d\n\nH/T 100Percent FedUp\n\nRelated", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180524233845im_/https://i0.wp.com/usbreakingnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ice_screenshot_20180524-230523.png?resize=55%2C55", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524233845im_/https://i1.wp.com/usbreakingnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ice_screenshot_20180403-235938.png?resize=300%2C165", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524233845im_/https://i0.wp.com/rwnofficial.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ward-payments.jpg?resize=890%2C294&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524233845im_/https://i1.wp.com/usbreakingnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Muslim-4-750x445.jpg?resize=300%2C165", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524233845im_/https://i1.wp.com/usbreakingnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ice_screenshot_20180524-225242.png?resize=55%2C55", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524233845im_/https://i2.wp.com/rwnofficial.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ward-payments-2.jpg?resize=740%2C134&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524233845im_/https://i2.wp.com/usbreakingnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ice_screenshot_20180419-221827.png?resize=300%2C165", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524233845im_/https://i1.wp.com/usbreakingnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/1-1.jpg?resize=300%2C165", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524233845im_/http://usbreakingnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/the-logo.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524233845im_/https://i0.wp.com/rwnofficial.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ward-email-carter-page-1.jpg?resize=740%2C695&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524233845im_/https://i2.wp.com/usbreakingnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ice_screenshot_20180522-233034.png?resize=700%2C367", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524233845im_/https://i2.wp.com/usbreakingnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Dgqm81523898755.png?resize=300%2C165", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524233845im_/https://i2.wp.com/usbreakingnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ice_screenshot_20180523-151547.png?resize=300%2C165", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524233845im_/https://i2.wp.com/usbreakingnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ice_screenshot_20180522-233034.png?fit=700%2C367", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524233845im_/https://i2.wp.com/usbreakingnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ice_screenshot_20180524-230103.png?resize=55%2C55", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524233845im_/https://i0.wp.com/rwnofficial.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ward-payments-3.jpg?resize=938%2C170&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524233845im_/https://i2.wp.com/usbreakingnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/comey1.jpg?resize=300%2C165", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524233845im_/https://i1.wp.com/usbreakingnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/JluDR1524000054.png?resize=300%2C165", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524233845im_/http://usbreakingnews.net/wp-content/plugins/itro-popup/images/close-icon.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524233845im_/https://i0.wp.com/usbreakingnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/eric-bower-mayor-of-bloomsburg-pa-facebook-640x480-640x381.jpg?resize=300%2C165", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524233845im_/https://i2.wp.com/usbreakingnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/egdnp1524083395.png?resize=300%2C165", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524233845im_/https://i1.wp.com/usbreakingnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/HKLwM1523309293.png?resize=300%2C165", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524233845im_/https://i1.wp.com/usbreakingnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ice_screenshot_20180524-225615.png?resize=55%2C55", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524233845im_/https://i2.wp.com/usbreakingnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ice_screenshot_20180524-230103.png?resize=300%2C165"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524233845im_/https://i2.wp.com/usbreakingnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ice_screenshot_20180522-233034.png?fit=700%2C367", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524233845/http://usbreakingnews.net/bombshell-obama-paid-fbi-informant-over-1-million-to-do-it-to-trump-even-after-the-election/", "title": "BOMBSHELL!!
