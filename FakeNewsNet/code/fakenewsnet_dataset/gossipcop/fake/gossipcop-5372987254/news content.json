The comedian began the movement on Twitter in protest of Trump not appointing a Latino to his cabinet, which every president has done since 1988. Lopez encouraged his followers to change their avatar to a brown square in support.\n\nTomorrow I'm going on a #Brownout in protest of @realDonaldTrump not having a Latino appointed to his cabinet , first time since 1988 pic.twitter.com/woEyaBjkoh \u2014 George Lopez (@georgelopez) January 20, 2017\n\nIn urge Latinos and people who support us to joint me and #Brownout on your Avatar #chingon pic.twitter.com/J7NHfjKlFl \u2014 George Lopez (@georgelopez) January 20, 2017\n\nChrissy Teigen, who has previously criticized Trump on Twitter, commented on the prayer portion of the inauguration. \u201cWhat a beautiful prayer. makes me wanna grab my p\u2014,\u201d she tweeted, alluding to Trump\u2019s infamous comment in his and Billy Bush\u2019s leaked tape.\n\nwhat a beautiful prayer. makes me wanna grab my puss \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) January 20, 2017\n\nTeigen soon commented on the attention her prayer tweet was receiving. \u201cOh. it\u2019s offensive when I say it though. hm,\u201d she wrote.\n\noh. it's offensive when I say it though. hm. \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) January 20, 2017\n\nMeanwhile, Shonda Rhimes praised Hillary Clinton and retweeted a list with 45 things to do other than watch the inauguration.\n\nMaturity, grace and oh boy, is she going high when they went low. https://t.co/kyqsVPlb22 \u2014 shonda rhimes (@shondarhimes) January 20, 2017\n\nKaty Perry, who was very vocal in her support of Clinton during the campaign, told her her 95 million Twitter followers that she\u2019d be sleeping in instead of watching Trump\u2019s inauguration.
