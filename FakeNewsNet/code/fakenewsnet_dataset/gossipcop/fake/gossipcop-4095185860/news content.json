The court papers obtained by PEOPLE stated, \u201cthe children not having a relationship with their father is harmful to them,\u201d and that Jolie, 43, could lose full custody of the kids if she doesn\u2019t allow them to grow their relationships with Pitt.\n\nMaddox, 16, his oldest son isn\u2019t included in the timetable. That\u2019s because according to the court, Maddox is old enough to decide for himself how much time he wants to spend with his father.\n\nImage zoom Pitt with Pax, Shiloh and Maddox (from left) in 2014.
