She is an amazing mother.\u201d\n\nHollywood\u2019s Ugliest Divorces\n\nIt\u2019s a description she\u2019s worked hard to achieve. Following her highly publicized breakdown in 2007, the pop star, now 36, was placed under dad Jamie\u2019s conservatorship and full custody of her kids was handed to Federline.

Says the source, \u201cKevin thinks her success is in part because the boys have been in her life.\u201d (After embarking on a world tour in July, she\u2019ll return to Vegas for a lucrative residency at the Park Theater.)\n\nStars At Court\n\nBut Spears is quick to see through her ex. As he has four other kids to support, \u201cBritney feels as if she is paying for them also,\u201d the insider says. \u201cHis rapping and DJ\u2019ing don\u2019t pay the bills.\u201d And neither will Spears \u2014 or her dad. \u201cJamie isn\u2019t going to meet an outrageous demand,\u201d says the source. \u201cHe knows how important the kids are to Britney and won\u2019t allow her to lose them.
