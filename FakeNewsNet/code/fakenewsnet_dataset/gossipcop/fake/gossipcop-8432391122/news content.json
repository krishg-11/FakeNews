Now that Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian welcomed her first child, True Thompson, with serial cheater boyfriend Tristan Thompson, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are looking to expand their family, again! The couple is already parents to North, 4, Saint, 2, and Chicago, 3 months, but a source told Radar Online they are itching for baby No. 4 by the end of this year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been a question of when, not if they\u2019ll add to the family,\u201d the source explained. \u201cThey\u2019re confident they can cope with this because of the support they have with childcare.\u201d And, yes, Kim will likely go the surrogate route again as the publication reported that she will probably use the same woman who carried Chicago.\n\nAlthough Kim and Kanye are ready for a fourth child \u2014 hopefully another son if Kanye had it his way \u2014 some close friends don\u2019t think it\u2019s such a good idea. Radar Online reported that this could be something that actually tears them apart since their relationship isn\u2019t in the greatest place at the moment.\n\n\u201cA lot of people think it\u2019s crazy, since their marriage is hardly in the ideal place and they\u2019re already struggling to cope with the demands of three kids,\u201d the source said. \u201cBut they\u2019re ignoring all reason and going with their impulse here.\u201d\n\nWhile Kim and Kanye have yet to comment on the possibility of adding to their family so soon, the KKW Beauty star did tell Elle\u2018s April issue that a fourth baby would be her last. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could handle more than [four kids]. My time is spread really thin,\u201d Kim explained. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s important that in all couples, the mom gives the husband as much attention as the kids.\u201d\n\nKim and Kanye started dating in April 2012 before tying the knot in 2014 and they are still the perfect match for each other. \u201cHe\u2019s taught me to have more of an opinion,\u201d Kim admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve taught him to be a bit more calm or cautious. We\u2019re a good balance.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Felicity-Jones-Pregnant.jpg?crop=0px%2C76px%2C2085px%2C2085px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/90-DF-Jesse-Meester-Reacts-to-Avery-and-Angelas-Tell-All-Feud.jpg?crop=0px%2C39px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/90-Day-Fiance-Star-Nicole-Jimenos-BF-01.jpg?crop=53px%2C39px%2C1906px%2C1080px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Meghan-King-Edmonds-Ready-to-Date-After-Jim-Edmonds-Divorce.jpg?crop=0px%2C78px%2C2770px%2C1572px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-family.png?w=1180&h=661&crop=1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tara-Reid-Transformation-Promo.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jamie-Otis-Claps-Back-at-Mom-Shaming-Sometimes.jpg?crop=0px%2C294px%2C3857px%2C2183px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kim-kanye-fourth-baby.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Olivia-Jade-and-Isabella-Gianulli-Dreading-Holidays-Amid-Mom-Lori-Loughlin-Legal-Battle-01.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/meghan-markle-prince-harry-kate-middleton-prince-william-reunite.png?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kim-kardashian-marie-antoinette-kanye-west.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kim-kanye-fourth-baby.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/princess-beatrice-cancels-engagement-party-amid-prince-andrew-scandal.jpg?crop=0px%2C428px%2C3516px%2C1990px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Celebs-With-the-Most-Outrageous-Demands-in-Hollywood-Promo.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/kardashian-sisters-7.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/an-unexpected-killer-larry-swartz-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2550px%2C1444px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Biel-Pushed-Justin-Timberlake-Make-a-Public-Statement-PDA-Scandal-Promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Baby-to-Age-4-See-Baby-Chanel-Nicole-Transformation-Over-the-Years-landing-01.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C2000px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/chicago-saint-west-photo.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jesse-Meester-Tom-Brooks-Bonded-Over-Darcey-Silva-Drama-01.jpg?crop=2px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kim-kanye-fourth-baby.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alex Riccardi"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-fourth-baby-158346/", "title": "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West Want a Fourth Baby, but It Could Ruin Their Marriage", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "The Kardashians have baby fever \u2014 literally.
