Her life isn\u2019t really changing \u2026 if anything, she\u2019s just busier.\u201d\n\nBoth Dewan and Tatum have been spotted out and about without their wedding rings since jointly announcing their split on April 2. Days after news of their breakup was made public, Dewan went back to shooting her upcoming TV show Mixtape.\n\nThis past weekend, Tatum stepped out for the Honda Indy Grand Prix on Sunday, attending his first public event since he and Dewan announced their split. The 37-year-old actor attended the event in Birmingham, Alabama, where he served as the grand marshal and hung out with Bachelor star Arie Luyendyk Jr.\n\nMeanwhile, Dewan has also slowly been returning to social media \u2014 and removed her married last name from her accounts (Tatum has yet to share anything new on social media).\n\nImage zoom Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan.

Love love love xx,\u201d Dewan wrote in the description.\n\nAnother source close to Dewan says, \u201cJenna is great. She seems very energetic and excited about her life.
