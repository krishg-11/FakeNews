All those cousins coming out of the woodwork, asking you to pass along their script or snag an autograph or even help Aunt Agatha buy that new hot tub that she desperately needs.\n\nThen there are those happy few stars who don\u2019t have to face this problem. Because their cousins are famous, too.\n\nIn honor of Cousins Day \u2013 July 24, to be exact \u2013 here are several celebrity cousins who don\u2019t have to worry about being the only famous person at their family reunion.\n\nJenny McCarthy and Melissa McCarthy\n\nImage zoom Jeny McCarthy (left) and Melissa McCarthy Noam Galai/WireImage; Steve Granitz/WireImage\n\nYou couldn\u2019t ask for a better cousin than Jenny McCarthy. Back in the \u201990s, The View host helped older cousin Melissa land her first TV role as a guest star in the former\u2019s short-lived sitcom.\n\nNow that both McCarthy girls have cemented their places in Hollywood, she\u2019s spoken out against criticism of Melissa on multiple occasions.\n\nTom Cruise and William Mapother\n\nImage zoom Tom Cruise (left) and William Mapother Christopher Polk/Getty; Henry S. Dziekan III/Getty\n\nOnce you know that Tom Cruise\u2018s real name is \u201cThomas Mapother,\u201d suddenly the resemblance between the A-lister and his character-actor cousin becomes a lot more apparent. (Look at their chins!)\n\nMapother has acted in five films with Cruise \u2013 Born on the Fourth of July, Magnolia, Mission: Impossible II, Vanilla Sky and Minority Report \u2013 but to us, he\u2019ll always be Ethan, the duplicitous member of the Others from Lost.\n\nSofia Coppola, Jason Schwartzman and Nicolas Cage\n\nImage zoom From left: Sofia Coppola, Nicolas Cage and Jason Schwartzman Jason Merritt/Getty; Francois G. Durand/WireImage; Frazer Harrison/Getty\n\nComposer Carmine Coppola unwittingly spawned a Hollywood dynasty: His son Francis became the famed director of The Godfather and Apocalypse Now, while his daughter Talia Shire starred as Adrian in the Rocky movies.\n\nDecades later, the second generation of Coppola cousins has gotten mixed up in the family business: Frances\u2019s daughter Sofia and Talia\u2019s son Jason have each followed in their parents\u2019 footsteps, while their cousin Nicolas (son of the comparatively unknown August Coppola) took a new name from one of his favorite superheroes and became the Internet\u2019s One True God.\n\nOther Coppola cousins in the entertainment industry include Sofia\u2019s older brother Roman, who co-wrote The Darjeeling Limited and Moonrise Kingdom, and Jason\u2019s younger brother Robert, lead singer of the band Rooney.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow and Katherine Moennig\n\nImage zoom Gwyneth Paltrow (left) and Katherine Moennig Donato Sardella/Getty; Gregg DeGuire/WireImage\n\nEven before she came to fame on The L Word, actress Katherine Moennig was haunted by questions about her blonder, goopier cousin.\n\nAs a 2000 New York Observer profile observed, when asked about Gwyneth, \u201ca wary look crossed Ms. Moennig\u2019s eyes and her facial muscles seemed to freeze up.\u201d\n\nLater, she revealed a certain gratefulness for their lack of resemblance: \u201cWe\u2019re totally different people. We look very different, too No one\u2019s judging me solely on the fact that I am her cousin.\u201d\n\nSnoop Dogg and Brandy\n\nImage zoom Brandy (left) and Snoop Dogg M. Caulfield/WireImage\n\nThis is one of those facts that you feel a lot more people should know than they do. We\u2019re talking two of the most famous musicians to come out of the \u201990s!\n\nAlthough perhaps that would have made it weird for them to collaborate on a love song, as they did on Snoop\u2019s \u201cSpecial.\u201d\n\nGary LeVox and Jay DeMarcus\n\nImage zoom Gary LeVox (left) and Jay DeMarcus Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic\n\nThough they\u2019re only second cousins, LeVox and DeMarcus probably hang out more than most of the relatives on this list. They have to \u2013 they\u2019re two of the three members of the country group Rascal Flatts!\n\nDamon Dash and Stacey Dash\n\nImage zoom Damon Dash and Stacey Dash J.Sciulli/WireImage\n\nMaybe we\u2019re mixing him up with Reverend Run, but we\u2019d always sort of assumed \u201cDamon Dash\u201d was not the name the former Roc-A-Fella Records honcho was born with. But it was!\n\nWhen you realize that your whole perspective was whack, it makes more sense that he\u2019s cousins with Clueless\u2018s Stacey Dash.\n\nMelissa Gorga and Ralph Macchio\n\nImage zoom Melissa Gorga and Raph Macchio Dave Kotinsky/Getty; Gilbert Carrasquillo/FilmMagic\n\nCousins often enjoy different levels of success at different points in their lives, but the comparison is striking in the case of these two relatives.\n\nMelissa Gorga was just a child when her cousin Ralph Macchio shot to fame in The Karate Kid \u2013 years later, he was working as a guest actor on shows like Psych and How I Met Your Mother when an all-grown-up Gorga became a cast member on The Real Housewives of New Jersey.\n\nK-Ci & JoJo and Fantasia Barrino\n\nImage zoom From left: K-Ci amp#38; JoJo and Fantasia Barrino Jun Sato/WireImage; Steve Granitz/WireImage\n\nAll their lives, brothers Cedric \u201cK-Ci\u201d and Joel \u201cJoJo\u201d Hailey have been cousins with American Idol winner Fantasia Barrino.\n\nThe trio haven\u2019t officially recorded together, but K-Ci did show up at a Fantasia concert to duet on \u201cNobody Greater\u201d with his younger cuz.\n\nKyra Sedgwick and Edie Sedgwick\n\nImage zoom Kyra Sedgwick (left) and Edie Sedgwick Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic; Herve Gloaguen/Rapho/Getty\n\nIf someone asks you to explain the concept of first cousins once removed, just tell them, \u201cIt\u2019s like Edie Sedgwick and Kyra Sedwick!\u201d (Edie\u2019s father was the younger brother of Kyra\u2019s grandfather.)\n\nBrooke Shields and Glenn Close\n\nImage zoom Brooke Shields (left) and Glenn Close Slaven Vlasic/Getty; Steve Granitz/WireImage\n\nLikewise, next time someone asks you how to explain the concept of second cousins once removed to them, just tell them, \u201cIt\u2019s like Brooke Shields and Glenn Close!\u201d (Shields\u2019s great-grandmother was the sister of Close\u2019s grandfather.)\n\nThe difference? You have probably met most of your first cousins once removed, at least once or twice (unless your parents hated their cousins). You probably haven\u2019t met many of your second cousins once removed.\n\nQueen Elizabeth and Prince Philip\n\nImage zoom Prince Philip and Queen Elizabeth Andrew Milligan/WPA//Getty\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that the royal families of Europe have different relationships with their cousins than the rest of us.\n\nTake, for example, Queen Elizabeth II and her husband Prince Philip, who are distant cousins.\n\nThat actually understates the complexity of their bloodlines, as Elizabeth and Philip are, in fact, related to each other twice.\n\nNot only are the couple each great-great-grandchildren of Queen Victoria, making them third cousins, they also share an ancestor in Christian IX of Denmark, who was Phillip\u2019s great-grandfather and Elizabeth\u2019s great-great-grandfather, thus making them second cousins once removed. (Like Brooke Shields and Glenn Close!)\n\nLike we said, royals are different.\n\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt\n\nImage zoom Franklin D. Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt Fotosearch/Getty\n\nBefore you snicker at the Queen, remember that America\u2019s rulers aren\u2019t any strangers to marrying their cousins, either.\n\nYes, Eleanor Roosevelt may have only been FDR\u2019s fifth cousin once removed, and yes, she may have been more closely related to the other Roosevelt president (she was Teddy\u2019s niece), but still \u2013 her maiden name was Roosevelt!\n\nYou could say the future president was just following in the family tradition, though; his own parents were sixth cousins.\n\nRELATED: See Jenny McCarthy and More Stars in Vintage Family Pics\n\n[IMAGE\u201d \u201c\u201d \u201c\u201d \u201c0\u201d ]", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/queen-elizabeth-600-8.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/kyra-sedgwick-600x450.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/gary-levox-435x580.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/sofia-copala-600x450.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/gwyneth-paltrow-600x450-12.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/jenny-mccarthy-600x450-3.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/brook-shields-600x450.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/tom-cruise-600x450-2.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/stacey-dsh-435.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/kci-jojo-600x450.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/fdr-435-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/snoop-dogg-435-10.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/jenny-mccarthy-600x450-3.jpg?w=600&h=450&crop=1", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/melissa-gorga-600x450.jpg"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/jenny-mccarthy-600x450-3.jpg?w=600&h=450&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nate Jones"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/celebrity/famous-cousins-melissa-mccarthy-jenny-mccarthy-and-other-stars-who-are-related/", "title": "Melissa McCarthy, Jenny McCarthy and Other Celeb Cousins You Never Knew Were Related", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "celebrity cousins, famous cousins, melissa mccarthy jenny mccarthy cousins, snoop dogg brandy cousins, nicolas cage cousin, tom cruise cousin, gwyneth paltrow katherine moenning cousins, queen elizabeth prince philip cousins", "news_keywords": "celebrity cousins, famous cousins, melissa mccarthy jenny mccarthy cousins, snoop dogg brandy cousins, nicolas cage cousin, tom cruise cousin, gwyneth paltrow katherine moenning cousins, queen elizabeth prince philip cousins", "description": "The worst part of being a celebrity, undoubtedly, must be family reunions.
