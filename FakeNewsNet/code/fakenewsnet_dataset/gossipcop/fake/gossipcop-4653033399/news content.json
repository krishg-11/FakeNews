She is much more careful about being flashy,\u201d the source says.\n\nKardashian West has previously spoken out about being a \u201cdifferent person\u201d since masked men held her at gunpoint at her apartment during Paris Fashion Week in October 2016 and took about $10 million worth of jewelry, including a $4 million ring. Now, that change extends to her new home with husband Kanye West and children North and Saint, the insider says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new year, with a new house and more changes,\u201d the source says. \u201cKim loves her new house. She wants to create the safest, best house for the kids. Along with their security team, Kim and Kanye have made plans to keep intruders out. Their new property is huge and requires even more 24/7 security staff. To keep the house safer, Kim doesn\u2019t want expensive possessions like jewelry at the house.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Donato Sardella/Getty Images for The Tot\n\nContinues the source, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t wear expensive jewelry every day, so it makes no sense to keep it at the house. Kim is trying to eliminate as many concerns as possible. After they bring the new baby home, Kim just wants to enjoy her family.\u201d\n\nThe Wests recently moved into their new Hidden Hills, California, home. \u201cThe new house is not completely finished, but it\u2019s safe for the kids,\u201d a source told PEOPLE in December. \u201cThe plan all along was to move in before the new baby arrives. Kim seems happy. She has help getting everything ready in the new house for all the kids.\u201d\n\nThe couple are currently expecting their third child together via surrogate.\n\nKardashian West retreated from the spotlight for several months after the robbery but has since been candid about the horrifying experience.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kanye and Kim Kardashian West\u2019s 2-Year-Old Son Saint Hospitalized with Pneumonia\n\nDuring an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in April, the 37-year-old got emotional as she said, \u201cI know this sounds crazy, but I know that was meant to happen to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to start crying, but \u2026 I\u2019m such a different person I really feel like things happen in your life to teach you things.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cIt was probably no secret, you see it on the show me being flashy, but I was definitely materialistic before. Not that there\u2019s anything bad about having things and working hard to get those things \u2014 and I\u2019m really proud of everyone that\u2019s around me that\u2019s successful. But I\u2019m so happy that my kids get this me. And that this is who is raising my kids. Because I just don\u2019t care about that stuff anymore, I really don\u2019t.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/best-fanbase-51.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cd9f66fb9786a84a19c058854794d94c?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/best-fanbase-51.jpg?crop=0px%2C29px%2C1150px%2C604px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/editorial-franchise-exclusive.png", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/best-fanbase-51.jpg?crop=0px%2C29px%2C1150px%2C604px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lindsay Kimble"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/kim-kardashian-safer-home-no-jewelry/", "title": "Kim Kardashian Doesn't Keep Jewels in Her New Home, Source Says", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Kim Kardashian, Kanye West, Kim and Kanye, Kim Kardashian robbery, Kim kardashian diamonds, Kim Kardashian no diamonds at mansion, kim kardashian west, kim kardashian robbed", "news_keywords": "Kim Kardashian, Kanye West, Kim and Kanye, Kim Kardashian robbery, Kim kardashian diamonds, Kim Kardashian no diamonds at mansion, kim kardashian west, kim kardashian robbed", "description": "Kim Kardashian West is ensuring her home is safe by keeping her expensive possessions, elsewhere", "og": {"title": "Kim Kardashian Doesn't Keep Jewels in Her New Home, Source Says", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/kim-kardashian-safer-home-no-jewelry/", "description": "Kim Kardashian West is ensuring her home is safe by keeping her expensive possessions, elsewhere", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/best-fanbase-51.jpg?crop=0px%2C29px%2C1150px%2C604px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/kim-kardashian-safer-home-no-jewelry/", "description": "Kim Kardashian West is ensuring her home is safe by keeping her expensive possessions, elsewhere", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/best-fanbase-51.jpg?crop=0px%2C29px%2C1150px%2C604px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/kim-kardashian-safer-home-no-jewelry/", "title": "Kim Kardashian Doesn't Keep Jewels in Her New Home, Source Says", "description": "Kim Kardashian West is ensuring her home is safe by keeping her expensive possessions, elsewhere", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/best-fanbase-51.jpg?crop=0px%2C29px%2C1150px%2C604px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://people.com", "summary": ""}
