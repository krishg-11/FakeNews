I should probably thank them!\u201d\n\nRELATED ARTICLE:\n\n\u2022 Inside Taylor\u2019s pretty in pink 18th birthday party!\n\nRELATED GAME:\n\n\u2022 Play matchmaker to the stars of country music in Love Connection!\n\nRELATED GALLERY:\n\n\u2022 From Tim & Faith to Keith & Kenny, read more about country music stars", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/taylor_swift240-2.jpg?w=240&h=320&crop=1", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/taylor_swift240-2.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/taylor_swift240-2.jpg?w=240&h=320&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lesley Messer"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/celebrity/taylor-swift-suffered-bullying-in-school/", "title": "Taylor Swift Suffered Bullying in School", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Musician, Roles, Individual, Taylor Swift", "news_keywords": "Musician, Roles, Individual, Taylor Swift", "description": "She may be country music's darling, but Taylor Swift's life wasn't always so sweet. \"Junior high was actually sort of\u2026", "og": {"title": "Taylor Swift Suffered Bullying in School", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/celebrity/taylor-swift-suffered-bullying-in-school/", "description": "The country star opens up about her real-life Mean Girls experience", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/taylor_swift240-2.jpg?w=240&h=320&crop=1", "width": 240, "height": 320}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/celebrity/taylor-swift-suffered-bullying-in-school/", "description": "She may be country music's darling, but Taylor Swift's life wasn't always so sweet. \"Junior high was actually sort of\u2026", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/taylor_swift240-2.jpg?w=240&h=320&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/celebrity/taylor-swift-suffered-bullying-in-school/", "title": "Taylor Swift Suffered Bullying in School", "description": "She may be country music's darling, but Taylor Swift's life wasn't always so sweet. \"Junior high was actually sort of\u2026", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/taylor_swift240-2.jpg?w=240&h=320&crop=1"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://people.com", "summary": ""}
