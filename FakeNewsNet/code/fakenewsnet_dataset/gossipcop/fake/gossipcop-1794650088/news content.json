Now that Pippa Middleton is pregnant with her first child and friends think Kate Middleton is pregnant with her fourth, the sisters are turning to each other for expert mom advice.\n\n\u201cThey confide in each other about everything,\u201d a source told Life & Style. \u201cWhen they were younger they\u2019d always share stories about boys and school life. Now they\u2019re sharing pregnancy stories!\u201d\n\nKate, who is already a mom to sons Prince George, 4, and Prince Louis, 2 months, and daughter Princess Charlotte, 3, is also helping her younger sister out with decorating her baby\u2019s room. \u201cShe\u2019s been giving Pippa lots of tips on what\u2019s to come and helping her with the nursery,\u201d the source added. \u201cShe\u2019s also given Pippa some of George and Charlotte\u2019s hand-me-downs but is obviously keeping some for Louis and her next baby.\u201d The insider continued, \u201cKate and Pippa have had so much fun shopping online for baby clothes and accessories!\u201d\n\nWhen Kate gave birth to her third royal baby with husband Prince William on April 23, Pippa was one of the first people to meet the family\u2019s new addition at Kensington Palace. So, now that Pippa, 34, is expecting her first little one with hubby James Matthews, the Middleton sisters are sure to be over the moon with baby joy! \u201cKate has so much knowledge to share,\u201d a friend of the siblings recently revealed to Us Weekly. \u201cShe\u2019s a walking baby encyclopedia at this point!\u201d\n\nThe news of Pippa\u2019s pregnancy first broke on April 21. \u201cWhen Pippa found out she was pregnant, she was obviously thrilled and utterly overjoyed,\u201d a source revealed to The Sun. \u201cNaturally, big sister Kate and [her] parents, Carole and Michael [Middleton], were the first people she told \u2014 James aside \u2014 and they could not have been more delighted.\u201d\n\nThen, just weeks after Pippa showed off her baby bump at the royal wedding and the French Open in Paris, the socialite confirmed she\u2019s expecting baby No. 1 on June 7. \u201cI was lucky to pass the 12-week scan without suffering from morning sickness. That meant I was able to carry on as normal,\u201d she wrote in her weekly column in Waitrose Kitchen Magazine. \u201cWhen I learned the happy news that I was pregnant I realized I needed to adjust my 4 to 5-day-a-week [workout] routine. I\u2019ve noticed my body change and weight increase, but through effective exercise and sports I feel that it\u2019s been strengthened to support a healthy pregnancy, birth and recovery\u2026 and ensure that post-baby, my old favorite jeans will still fit eventually!\u201d\n\nShortly after Pippa and James\u2019 lavish May 2017 wedding, a royal insider told Life & Style that the couple was eager to start a family. \u201cThey are trying for a baby, and Pippa might already be expecting. I know she would love to be pregnant at the same time as Kate,\u201d the source said at the time. \u201cShe would love to have a boy first and then a girl. She wants three children.\u201d We\u2019re so happy for the sisters!\n\nJoin our Facebook group for the latest updates on Kate Middleton, Prince William, and all things royal!", "images": ["https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Tim-Mcgraw-recalls-daughter-audreys-birth.jpg?crop=0px%2C103px%2C3261px%2C3261px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/melanie-griffith-dakota-johnson.jpg?crop=330px%2C52px%2C2467px%2C1398px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/melanie-griffith-loves-antonio-banderas-.jpg?crop=0px%2C58px%2C2177px%2C1233px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CL2319_cover_cn2_View-1.jpg?w=300", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/who-is-desi-arnaz-jr.jpg?crop=485px%2C0px%2C1831px%2C1831px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pippa-middleton-kate-middleton.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pippa-middleton.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Joel-Schiffman-INSTA.png?crop=0px%2C0px%2C554px%2C314px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jason-Priestley-advice2.jpg?crop=0px%2C186px%2C2400px%2C1360px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/gettyimages-687107096.jpg?w=1180&h=500&crop=1", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/meghan-markle-pippa-middleton-green-dress.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/marie-osmond-debuts-short-hair-the-talk.png?crop=341px%2C0px%2C898px%2C897px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Oliver-Kate-Hudson-recall-parents-having-child-1.jpg?crop=70px%2C0px%2C1852px%2C1852px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/crisis-main-1.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pippa-middleton-kate-middleton.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pippa-middleton-baby-bump.jpg?w=1180&h=1200&crop=1", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kate-middleton-pippa-middleton.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/lets-talk-to-lucy-main.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/gilligans-island-cast.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/william-frawley-fred-mertz.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/donnie-wahlberg-jenny-mccarthy-marriage-advice02.jpg?crop=54px%2C149px%2C2804px%2C1587px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/john-lennon-paul-mccartney-1.jpg?resize=120%2C68"], "top_img": "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pippa-middleton-kate-middleton.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julia Birkinbine"], "canonical_link": "https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/pippa-middleton-kate-middleton-pregnant-baby-advice-158793/", "title": "Pregnant Pippa Middleton Turns to Kate Middleton for Mom Advice", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "How sweet!
