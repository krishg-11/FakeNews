See a selection of remembrances below.\n\n\u201cA big hearted, big tent, compassionate man- in full embrace in his life of people in need- and of the potential of art, music, poetry and film to fill that need- a big loss to the caring world.\u201d \u2014 Meryl Streep\n\n\u201cJonathan taught us how big a heart a person can have, and how it will guide how we live and what we do for a living. He was the grandest of men.\u201d \u2014 Tom Hanks\n\n\u201cI am heart-broken to lose a friend, a mentor, a guy so singular and dynamic you\u2019d have to design a hurricane to contain him. Jonathan was as quirky as his comedies and as deep as his dramas. He was pure energy, the unstoppable cheerleader for anyone creative. Just as passionate about music as he was about art, he was and will always be a champion of the soul. JD, most beloved, something wild, brother of love, director of the lambs. Love that guy. Love him so much.\u201d \u2014 Jodie Foster\n\n\u201cI am really shocked and very sad to hear about Jonathan\u2019s passing. He was one of the best, and a really nice guy as well who had such a great spirit. My condolences to his family.\u201d \u2014 Anthony Hopkins\n\n\u201cJonathan Demme came into my life when he directed me in Melvin and Howard. I won an Oscar for that role and I can\u2019t imagine that having happened with any other director. He was pure magic. Brilliant technically but he never let that make him isolated. He included everyone on that set in the making of the movie in the most edgy, thrilling, wildly collaborative way. He did the same thing in Philadelphia. And, there, we never forgot for a moment that that film could change the experience of being HIV positive in this country and it did. The heartbeat and the integrity of it began with Jonathan\u2019s goodness and sense of justice. I\u2019m so proud to have been in it.\n\nI think the last public appearance he may have made was to host the NYC screening of my son, Charlie McDowell\u2019s film, The Discovery. It can\u2019t have been easy for him to go to NYC from Nyack and do that a couple of weeks before his death. But Jonathan celebrated and honored creativity more fiercely than anyone I have ever known. My daughter worked with him in The Manchurian Candidate. We all admired him so much. I send all of our family\u2019s love to his beautiful family and I will hold him where he\u2019s always been, in my heart, forever.\u201d \u2014 Mary Steenburgen\n\n\u201cWhenever I ran into Jonathan, he was filled with enthusiasm and excitement about a new project. He took so much joy in moviemaking. His pictures have an inner lyricism that just lifts them off the ground \u2014 even a story like The Silence of the Lambs. I have great admiration for Jonathan as a filmmaker \u2014 I love the freshness of his style and his excellent use of music, from Buddy Holly to Miklos Rozsa. There\u2019s so much more to be said, and I hardly know where to begin. I also loved him as a friend, and to me he was always young. My young friend. The idea that he\u2019s gone seems impossible to me.\u201d \u2014 Martin Scorsese\n\nVery sad to hear of the passing of the great Jonathan Demme. Admired his movies, his documentaries, his concert films. He could do anything. \u2014 edgarwright (@edgarwright) April 26, 2017\n\nToo many great films to mention: Something Wild, Stop Making Sense, Silence Of The Lambs, Melvin & Howard, among countless varied others. https://t.co/jU1pwXqlxq \u2014 edgarwright (@edgarwright) April 26, 2017\n\nRIP dearest Jonathan Demme. The world lost one of its purest, most loving and talented souls today. My heart is broken. I love you. \u2014 Christine Lahti (@ChristineALahti) April 26, 2017\n\nSad to hear that Jonathan Demme has passed. \u2014 Elijah Wood (@elijahwood) April 26, 2017\n\nTed Demme and I were worried about making The Ref when his uncle Jonathan Demme said something profound: \"Stop talking and start shooting.\" \u2014 Denis Leary (@denisleary) April 26, 2017\n\nDeeply sad to hear my friend, neighbor, and colleague Jonathan Demme has passed on. He was one of the real good guys. I miss you, buddy. \u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) April 26, 2017\n\nI know now that this was also the last time I saw Jonathan Demme. Fitting that it was in an act of love and generosity. Such a kind man. https://t.co/qYUZqXz2NU \u2014 Barry Jenkins (@BarryJenkins) April 26, 2017\n\nJonathan Demme and self in New York in 1996. He loved people, he loved filming them; I am so sad to hear he's gone. RIP JD xx pic.twitter.com/wbgdNZfih7 \u2014 Robyn Hitchcock (@RobynHitchcock) April 26, 2017\n\nRest In Peace, JD\u2026 \u2014 ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) April 26, 2017\n\nJonathan Demme optioned The Orchid Thief and steered it to becoming \"Adaptation\". He was brilliant, charming, warm, funny. RIP, Jonathan. \u2014 Susan Orlean (@susanorlean) April 26, 2017\n\nJust heard Jonathan Demme has passed. I can't process. He's a hero, an artist, an example, a goal, a visionary, a pinnacle & a master. RIP \u2014 Paul Feig (@paulfeig) April 26, 2017\n\nRest In Peace, Jonathan Demme. Passing of a great cinematic artist. \u2014 James Wan (@creepypuppet) April 26, 2017\n\nI picture Jonathan Demme only smiling at me with inquisitive light in his eyes. I'm saddened to think of the pain of his last act. Free now. \u2014 Jeffrey Wright (@jfreewright) April 26, 2017\n\nJonathan Demme was a great artist, humanitarian, activist & a warm encouraging colleague. I've known very few like him. He will be missed https://t.co/wQv5QRqHoN \u2014 Ron Howard (@RealRonHoward) April 26, 2017\n\nR.I.P #JonathanDemme one of a kind \u2014 Tony Todd (@TonyTodd54) April 26, 2017\n\n-artist \u2013 friend \u2013 neighbor \u2013 i will miss ur brilliance jonathan demme \u2014 ROSIE (@Rosie) April 26, 2017\n\nOften on tour I'll watch Jonathan Demme's \"Heart of Gold\" to remind me of what performance is about. Demme was a one of a kind filmmaker. \u2014 Mike Birbiglia (@birbigs) April 26, 2017\n\nUgh. Two artists I knew and liked both dead: Martha Lavey and Jonathan Demme. To paraphrase an S-town sundial: Not tedious, but brief. \u2014 Ira Glass (@iraglass) April 26, 2017\n\nHappier times. I will always love you Jonathan Demme. pic.twitter.com/grZRknHClb \u2014 Nia Vardalos (@NiaVardalos) April 26, 2017\n\nSad to hear of Jonathan Demme's passing. I did not get a chance to work with him, but came very close twice. What a warm, gracious man. \u2014 David Simon (@AoDespair) April 26, 2017\n\nJonathan Demme was a true inspiration. From humble Corman roots to deftly handling genre (sometimes more than one),he was an original.#RIP pic.twitter.com/ahtSdkvHvd \u2014 Joe Lynch (@TheJoeLynch) April 26, 2017\n\nI only worked with him once \u2013 he was just like his films: brilliant, curious & original.

Silence of the Lambs is in my forever rolodex of nightmares & turns me into the terrified child I was when I 1st saw it. \u2014 Kumail Nanjiani (@kumailn) April 26, 2017\n\nOh no. Jonathan Demme. One of our great filmmakers one of the most beautiful souls on the planet. Another magical irreplaceable friend gone. \u2014 Stevie Van Zandt (@StevieVanZandt) April 26, 2017\n\nREST IN PEACE, MR.

He could literally do anything and did it all masterfully. Never knew him but everyone loved him. Sad news. \u2014 Eli Roth (@eliroth) April 26, 2017\n\nJonathan Demme was a gifted and versatile filmmaker. RIP. \u2014 Michael McKean (@MJMcKean) April 26, 2017\n\nVery sad to share this news about a wonderful director, a deep lover of movies, and a very kind man. https://t.co/jqP9MDXNs6 \u2014 Mark Harris (@MarkHarrisNYC) April 26, 2017\n\nSo sad to learn of the death of one of my all-time favorite directors, the brilliant, humane Jonathan Demme. Silence of the Lambs & others. \u2014 Anthony Rapp (@albinokid) April 26, 2017\n\nworth noting too that in the rather white film industry Demme really did try to give screen time to Black actors & stories pic.twitter.com/nAa0dfoYQY \u2014 Saladin Ahmed (@saladinahmed) April 26, 2017\n\n\"The chance to make a film that deals in an imaginative way with stuff you care tremendously about is a real high.\" \u2014 Jonathan Demme #RIP pic.twitter.com/Z7axx3fgt5 \u2014 Tribeca (@Tribeca) April 26, 2017", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/gettyimages-523360674.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/gettyimages-523360674.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dan Heching"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/04/26/jonathan-demme-dead-celebs-react/", "title": "Celebrities react to the death of Jonathan Demme: 'He could do anything'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Jonathan Demme, Silence of the Lambs, Jonathan Demme dead,", "news_keywords": "Jonathan Demme, Silence of the Lambs, Jonathan Demme dead,", "description": "Jonathan Demme, Oscar-winning director of The Silence of the Lambs, died Wednesday at 73.", "og": {"title": "Celebrities React to the Death of Jonathan Demme: 'He Could Do Anything'", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/04/26/jonathan-demme-dead-celebs-react/", "description": "Jonathan Demme, the Oscar-winning director of\u00a0The Silence of the Lambs, Philadelphia, Rachel Getting Married, and much more, died Wednesday at\u2026", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/gettyimages-523360674.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/04/26/jonathan-demme-dead-celebs-react/", "description": "Jonathan Demme, Oscar-winning director of The Silence of the Lambs, died Wednesday at 73.", "media": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/gettyimages-523360674.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/04/26/jonathan-demme-dead-celebs-react/", "title": "Celebrities React to the Death of Jonathan Demme: 'He Could Do Anything'", "description": "Jonathan Demme, Oscar-winning director of The Silence of the Lambs, died Wednesday at 73.", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/gettyimages-523360674.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493179200.0, "source": "http://ew.com", "summary": ""}
