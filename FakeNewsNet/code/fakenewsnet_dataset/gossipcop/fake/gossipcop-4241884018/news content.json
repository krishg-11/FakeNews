It is hard to imagine a My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy \u2014 one of the greatest rap albums of all time \u2014 without an \u201cImma let you finish\u201d at the 2009 VMAs.\n\nHis new album, ye, doesn\u2019t merit any similar mercy.\n\nOn first listen, it doesn\u2019t sound like any part of ye was recorded pre-MAGA hat picture, which blows a Kanye-head sized hole through the argument that the previous month\u2019s behavior was a publicity stunt to promote the album. If anything, the album seems like an meek afterthought to the Twitter tirade and dive into right-wing politics. Most of it deals with the repercussions of the storm which came before it, and for the first time in his career, the artist\u2019s personality is overwhelming the art.\n\nThe opening track \u2018I Thought About Killing You\u2019, if played in a vacuum, sounds like the work of a troubled mind. If a poem like this came from a loved one, it would surely merit discussion about a trip to the therapist. Kanye goes on to deliver cringe-worthy rhymes on issues ranging from Russell Simmons rape allegations to his petrification on realizing that his daughter might one day look like his wife. He teases a few tidbits of The Old Kanye, chopping up beats from Slick Rick and The Edwin Hawkins Singers samples on \u2018No Mistakes\u2019, to keep his fans just interested enough. It\u2019s telling that the one standout track, \u2018Ghost Town\u2019 is the track on which Kanye lurks in the background, devoting more time on production than on spoken word, and letting John Legend and Kid Cudi take over.\n\nIf one were to ignore everything that came before ye, it would still feel like Kanye didn\u2019t even try this time. The usual meticulousness and perfectionism has apparently been supplanted by a Kanye shrug. The music is haphazard and hollow, mirroring the guy making it. Maybe he\u2019s become blas\u00e9 and doesn\u2019t want to spend time on music anymore. He did say he wanted to run for President in 2020 (or 2024?) anyway.", "images": ["https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/1*EJWWqLFxO3qHFirmTpOrfA.jpeg", "https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*MaFrQXaHuL6cNCBL5V9eUQ.png?q=20", "https://miro.medium.com/max/640/1*MaFrQXaHuL6cNCBL5V9eUQ.png", "https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*MaFrQXaHuL6cNCBL5V9eUQ.png", "https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/96/96/1*EJWWqLFxO3qHFirmTpOrfA.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://miro.medium.com/max/640/1*MaFrQXaHuL6cNCBL5V9eUQ.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Arjun Ogale"], "canonical_link": "https://medium.com/@arjunogale/kanye-west-indefinitely-canceled-8293412b5252", "title": "Kanye West, Indefinitely Canceled", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#000000", "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"iphone": "Medium"}, "id": {"iphone": 828256236}, "url": {"iphone": "medium://p/8293412b5252"}}, "title": "Kanye West, Indefinitely Canceled", "site": "@Medium", "description": "The first time I listened to a Kanye West album was in 2013, during my freshman year of college.
