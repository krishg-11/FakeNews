The photo was captioned: \u201cjust discussing #TheBigShort.\u201d\n\nAt the time, the brunette singer made no secret of how attractive she found the 52-year-old, saying: \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie. It\u2019s nice to look at all of the hot guys I admire. I\u2019m trying to find Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt right now!\u201d\n\nHowever according to the National Enquirer, the image did not go down well with Pitt\u2019s wife of two years.\n\n\u201cAngie blew a gasket when she saw Selena\u2019s Instagram, and heard through friends about how brad and Selena flirted so shamelessly,\u201d a source said.\n\nThe source continued: \u201cNow Selena is bragging to everyone that Brad is gung ho to make another movie with her. Selena is going around jokingly calling Brad \u2018my future husband\u2019, and Angie is obviously none too pleased.\u201d\n\nAccording to the publication, Jolie demanded that Pitt didn\u2019t work with the young star again. Gomez previously dated Justin Bieber and was linked to Orlando Bloom.\n\n\u201cAngie warned Brad to cut all ties with Selena, and she\u2019s forbidding him from working with her again,\u201d the source said.\n\nJolie filed for divorce from her partner of 12 years on Monday. Divorce papers show the Hollywood actress wants overall physical custody of their six children \u2014 not joint custody with Pitt \u2014 after citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nRELATIONSHIP TIMELINE\n\nIt\u2019s thought that numerous factors have contributed to her decision, including claims he grew too close to his Allied co-star Marion Cottilard and that his reported weed consumption and temper had got too much for her and she was concerned about the environment she was bringing up the kids in.\n\nFollowing the news, Pitt went public with a statement about his impending divorce which read: \u201cI am very saddened by this, but what matters most now is the wellbeing of our kids. I kindly ask the press to give them the space they deserve during this challenging time.\u201d\n\nHe has also categorically denied the allegations of his supposed affair.\n\nJolie released a similar statement saying that the divorce was for the \u201chealth of the family.\u201d\n\nThis story originally appeared in The Sun.", "images":
