So it\u2019s pretty fitting that Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson, America\u2019s current muscular hero and highest-paid movie star in the world, would bring it to the big screen.\n\nAs a raunchy, R-rated comedy, Baywatch touches all the bases you\u2019d expect: Plenty of male genitalia jokes, cursing, and flattering shots of beautiful women, but it also has room for fun, action-packed set pieces, a few heartwarming moments, and great chemistry between Johnson and Zac Efron, which powers the funniest parts of the film. Sure, it won\u2019t win any Academy Awards and there are a few too many obvious jokes, but with a killer soundtrack and Johnson\u2019s charm, it\u2019s a fun movie experience.\n\nJohnson leads the way as Lieutenant Mitch Buchannon, the top dog of Emerald City\u2019s titular lifeguard team and a sort-of local hero to the citizens of the town (\u201cHe started Google and then gave it away anonymously,\u201d says one beachgoer as Buchannon walks by.). After diving into the water to save a wind surfer who crashes into the ocean, Buchannon jogs down the shore and gives an introduction to the inhabitants of the beach: We meet Stephanie (Ilfenesh Hadera) and CJ (Kelly Rohrbach), the unbelievably beautiful fellow lifeguards; a group of recruits who hope to join the team in the annual tryouts, Summer (Alexandra Daddario), Ronnie (Jon Bass), and Olympic bad-boy Matt Brody (Efron); and the mysterious Victoria Leeds (Priyanka Chopra), a sand-averse private club owner who has some nefarious plans up her sleeve.\n\nCourtesy of Paramount Pictures / Baywatch\n\nBrody is a cocky, party-loving two-time Olympic gold medalist who has fallen on hard times after blowing the team relay at the Rio Olympics. Brody gets nicknamed the \u201cVomit Comet\u201d after hurling in the pool after a hard-drinking night, letting his team and country down. While Brody\u2019s backstory is meant to reference real-life Olympian Ryan Lochte, the filmmakers had no idea art would imitate life so much after Lochte actually got involved in shenanigans in Brazil following a night of partying in summer 2016.\n\nBrody\u2019s cockiness pushes against Buchannon\u2019s gung-ho attitude about the lifeguard team, and, after resisting the tryout, thinking that he deserves a spot based on his world-record swimming alone, the two go head-to-head in a pseudo-strongman contest that\u2019s basically a reason to show off Johnson and Efron\u2019s muscles. Both stars are absolutely jacked in this film, with Efron looking like he was carved by a sculptor into a perfect specimen with rock-hard abs and bulging pecs, while Johnson is a bit leaner than his Luke Hobbs character in Fate of the Furious, but still huge. (Efron told Men\u2019s Fitness about the workout he used to get ripped for Baywatch, and, after seeing the film, one thing\u2019s for certain: It worked.)\n\nThings get moving pretty quickly once Buchannon finds some drugs washed up on the beach, eventually tracing things back to Leeds. The team investigates a dead body that washes up and connects it to Leeds\u2019 plan of buying up real estate along the beach with the profits from selling drugs. The only problem? The Baywatch team doesn\u2019t have much authority.\n\nCourtesy of Paramount Pictures / Baywatch\n\nAquaman villain Yahya Abdul-Mateen plays a local cop who loves to remind Buchannon any chance he can get that his \u201cLieutenant\u201d position doesn\u2019t mean a thing. But that doesn\u2019t stop the team from going undercover to try and expose Leeds\u2019 plan anyway, bringing out some of the most ridiculous sequences of the film. If you ever wanted to hear Johnson and Efron argue about a dead man\u2019s \u201ctaint,\u201d well, you\u2019re in luck. The team breaks into the city morgue to see if Leeds is covering up a murder, and Brody ends up with a handful of balls and later a mouthful of liquified fat.\n\nApart from the gross-out factor, this scene highlights why Johnson and Efron\u2019s chemistry makes for some of the funniest moments of the film. One of the best running gags is Buchannon refusing to call Brody by name, using nicknames like \u201cBieber,\u201d \u201cN\u2019Sync,\u201d \u201cOne Direction,\u201d and the super-meta \u201cHigh School Musical\u201d instead, eventually warming to the bad boy as the team investigates more dead bodies showing up on the beach.\n\nChopra is a standout among the cast, smoldering in every scene she\u2019s in. While her character isn\u2019t sketched out much\u2014there\u2019s only so much time to spare in a two-hour movie\u2014she has a few highlight moments, including when she has a dance off with Ronnie at her club, and in the climax of the film when she goes full supervillain during a fight with Brody and Buchannon.\n\nCourtesy of Paramount Pictures / Baywatch\n\nBass gives a laugh-out-loud performance as the nerdy \u201ctech guy\u201d who is in love with CJ, and makes the Baywatch team by showing \u201cno quit\u201d in the tryout. Despite being very pretty faces, Daddario, Hadera, and Rohrbach aren\u2019t just there to look good\u2014although they certainly do\u2014but they all have a part to play on the team, which becomes abundantly clear when they save Brody from a fiery, exploding boat during a rescue mission.\n\nComparisons will be made to the 21 Jump Street film series due to the fact that both are remakes/reboots of old TV shows and follow a story tied to drug dealers, but director Seth Gordon (Horrible Bosses) does a very solid job of making Baywatch unique, creating some fun action scenes (Johnson\u2019s character gets to slam a garbage can of used diapers onto one of Leeds\u2019 henchmen after a jet ski chase), and making sure the team comes across as a \u201cfamily,\u201d and not just some people who work together and rush home at the end of the day.\n\nSpeaking of going home, one of the most hilarious moments of the film comes when Brody has to crash at Buchannon\u2019s house\u2014a place that looks so expensive, there\u2019s no way a lifeguard has any business owning, renting, or living in it\u2014and finds something in a fish tank staring directly back at him while he sleeps: A miniature version of Buchannon in his lifeguard uniform holding a trident. Later in the film the figurine changes for hilarious effect, but we won\u2019t spoil that gag for you\u2014just be sure to keep an eye on the fish tank.\n\nThere are two major cameos in the film with actors from the original series, and while we won\u2019t spoil that either, it\u2019s pretty obvious who will show up if you\u2019re familiar with the television show. Both cameos are mined for laughs and actually fit in pretty naturally with the storyline, so they don\u2019t feel superfluous at all.\n\nThe final scene hints at a potential sequel for the film, and the end credits show off some hilarious outtakes and deleted scenes that didn\u2019t make it into the final cut.\n\nBaywatch may not go down in the pantheon of all-time comedies, but the film is wildly entertaining, features hilarious performances, and is a welcome respite from the big-budget, save-the-world, save-humanity blockbusters that are all too common at the cineplex these days.\n\nCourtesy of Paramount Pictures / Baywatch\n\nFor access to exclusive gear videos, celebrity interviews, and more, subscribe on YouTube!", "images":
