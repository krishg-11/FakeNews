Ricky got me good! I was so happy that I couldn\u2019t quit smiling. My cheeks hurt!\u201d\n\nThe 31-year-old fertility nurse met sales manager Angel on the dating app Bumble (\u201cLadies pick \u2014 finally it was my choice,\u201d jokes Bischoff) last September; the couple moved in together in May.\n\n\u201cOn our first date, we just clicked,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was easy and that\u2019s the way it should be.\u201d\n\nStill, Bischoff admits it was \u201cnerve-wracking\u201d to jump back into the dating scene after her painful split from Soules in 2015, nearly seven months after they were engaged. \u201cI was still a little bit broken and trying to pick up the pieces. But from day one there was open communication with Ricky about what I had gone through. I think one of the reasons I fell in love so quickly is that I could say everything and know I was not being judged.\u201d\n\nBischoff hasn\u2019t spoken to Soules recently but says she wishes him well. \u201cI hope that he meets someone, if he hasn\u2019t already, just as great for him and Ricky is for me.\u201d\n\nNow, Bischoff still watches The Bachelor, but says she\u2019s moved on from her own reality show past. \u201cThat journey was a big part of my life,\u201d she says. \u201cBut since I\u2019ve met Ricky, I really haven\u2019t looked back.\u201d\n\nBusy with wedding plans (the couple are looking at a date next fall), Bischoff says she nonetheless has positive associations with the show. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that it ended the way it had to end, but I was still looking for that perfect someone. I didn\u2019t let my past close off my heart. Everything works out for a reason.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/whitney-bischoff-600.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/whitney-bischoff-600.jpg?w=600&h=600&crop=1", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/whitney-bischoff-600.jpg?w=600&h=600&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aili Nahas"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/bachelor-whitney-bischoff-talks-engagement-didnt-let-past-close-off-heart/", "title": "Bachelor Whitney Bischoff Talks Engagement: Didnt Let Past Close Off Heart", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "whitney bischoff, bachelor, whitney bischoff bachelor, chris soules, whitney bischoff chris soules", "news_keywords": "whitney bischoff, bachelor, whitney bischoff bachelor, chris soules, whitney bischoff chris soules", "description": "Millions of people watched her get engaged to Chris Soules on national television last year, but when former Bachelor star\u2026", "og": {"title": "The Bachelor's Whitney Bischoff Opens Up on Getting Engaged: 'I Didn't Let My Past Close Off My Heart'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/bachelor-whitney-bischoff-talks-engagement-didnt-let-past-close-off-heart/", "description": "The Bachelor winner got engaged to Ricky Angel last month", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/whitney-bischoff-600.jpg?w=600&h=600&crop=1", "width": 600, "height": 600}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/bachelor-whitney-bischoff-talks-engagement-didnt-let-past-close-off-heart/", "description": "Millions of people watched her get engaged to Chris Soules on national television last year, but when former Bachelor star\u2026", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/whitney-bischoff-600.jpg?w=600&h=600&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/bachelor-whitney-bischoff-talks-engagement-didnt-let-past-close-off-heart/", "title": "The Bachelor's Whitney Bischoff Opens Up on Getting Engaged: 'I Didn't Let My Past Close Off My Heart'", "description": "Millions of people watched her get engaged to Chris Soules on national television last year, but when former Bachelor star\u2026", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/whitney-bischoff-600.jpg?w=600&h=600&crop=1"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://people.com", "summary": ""}
