It was always hard for Jen to understand why Justin didn\u2019t like, or at least could learn to like L.A., when she was in L.A.,\u201d the source shared.\n\nFor a long time, the couple accommodated each other, with Theroux spending more and more time on his own in New York City. \u201cWith Jen feeling so strongly about living in L.A. and disliking N.Y.C. so much, she wanted Justin to be happy and that\u2019s why she agreed that he should spend so much time in N.Y.C.,\u201d said the insider.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/jennifer-aniston.jpg?w=768", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/theroux-aniston-2.jpg?w=768", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/theroux-aniston-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/theroux-aniston-4.jpg?w=768", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/jennifer-aniston1.jpg?w=768", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/justin-theroux3.jpg?w=768", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/theroux-aniston-3.jpg?w=768", "http://people.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/theroux-aniston-1.jpg?w=768", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/jennifer-aniston.jpg?w=768", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/jennifer-aniston.jpg?w=768", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/theroux-aniston-5.jpg?w=768"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/theroux-aniston-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["People Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux-breakup-relationship-details/", "title": "Everything We Know About Jennifer Aniston & Justin Theroux's Split", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "jennifer aniston, justin theroux, jen and justin, jennifer aniston split, jennifer aniston breakup, justin theroux breakup", "news_keywords": "jennifer aniston, justin theroux, jen and justin, jennifer aniston split, jennifer aniston breakup, justin theroux breakup", "description": "The couple was together for seven years (and married for two) before announcing their separation in February 2018", "og": {"title": "Everything We Know About Jennifer Aniston & Justin Theroux's Split", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/movies/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux-breakup-relationship-details/", "description": "The couple was together for seven years (and married for two) before announcing their separation in February 2018", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/theroux-aniston-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/movies/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux-breakup-relationship-details/", "description": "The couple was together for seven years (and married for two) before announcing their separation in February 2018", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/theroux-aniston-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/movies/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux-breakup-relationship-details/", "title": "Everything We Know About Jennifer Aniston & Justin Theroux's Split", "description": "The couple was together for seven years (and married for two) before announcing their separation in February 2018", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/theroux-aniston-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/movies/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux-breakup-relationship-details/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://people.com", "summary": ""}
