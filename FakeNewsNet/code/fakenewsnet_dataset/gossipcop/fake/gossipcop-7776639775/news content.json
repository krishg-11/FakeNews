The former Yankees star is ready to pop the question to his girlfriend of nearly one year, and sources reveal exclusively to Life & Style that A-Rod is pulling out all the stops on his upcoming proposal.\n\n\u201cA-Rod dropped $3 million on a custom 15-carat diamond engagement ring,\u201d a source says. Though he didn\u2019t consult her about it, \u201che knows her style,\u201d the insider adds. \u201cBig stone, lots of little bling on the band.\u201d And if everything goes to plan, Alex will be getting down on one knee during the holidays.\n\n\u201cHe wants to start the New Year knowing Jennifer will be his wife,\u201d explains an insider. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have to do it, but A-Rod asked Jen\u2019s mom [Guadalupe] and dad [David] for permission to marry their daughter. Of course, they said yes.\u201d\n\nDespite her three prior divorces, J.Lo, 48, has never given up on the idea of marriage. \u201cI\u2019m not saying marrying again is out of the question \u2014 but then, nothing in my life is out of the question,\u201d she said in 2016. \u201cEverything and anything is possible. I don\u2019t put limits on myself.\u201d\n\nThe couple has also made it very clear that they are ready to take their relationship to the next level. Along with already blending their families, Jennifer\u2019s nine-year-old twins Max and Emme are already BFFs with Alex\u2019s daughter Natasha, 13, and Ella, 9, the pair couldn\u2019t stop gushing about each other in their recent Vanity Fair cover story.\n\n\u201cWe are very much twins,\u201d Alex, 42, said. \u201cWe\u2019re both Leos; we\u2019re both from New York; we\u2019re both Latino and about 20 other things.\u201d Jennifer added, \u201cI understand him in a way that I don\u2019t think anyone else could, and he understands me in a way that no one else could ever.\u201d She continued, \u201cBecause a lot of people I\u2019ve met in my life, they don\u2019t appreciate what they\u2019re doing and how amazing it is\u2026 not the greatness of the house, but the moment of sitting there with someone you love, with a family, with healthy kids.\u201d We have a feeling fourth time will be the charm!\n\nFor more exclusive celebrity news, be sure to pick up the latest issue of Life & Style on newsstands now.", "images": ["https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LS2319_cover_ns4_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/jennifer-lopez-engagement-ring.png?resize=860%2C552", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Sofia-Richie-Scott-Disick-Miami-5.jpg?crop=0px%2C340px%2C2038px%2C2038px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Priyanka-Chopra-Nick-Jonas-Exclusive.jpg?crop=0px%2C54px%2C1984px%2C1124px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jennifer-lopez-ex-casper-smart.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emma-Stone-Engaged-to-Boyfriend-Dave-McCary-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1408px%2C1408px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/teddi-mellencamp-tips-to-conceive-feature-e1575835265340.jpg?crop=0px%2C82px%2C1393px%2C789px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Britney-Spears-singing.jpg?crop=436px%2C0px%2C1601px%2C1601px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Alessandra-Ambrosio.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1699px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jenna-Dewan-Steve-Kazee-Relationship-Timeline-Promo.jpg?crop=145px%2C0px%2C1736px%2C1736px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Hannah-Brown-and-Alan-Bersten.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C2310px%2C1309px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jeweler-Reveals-Story-Behind-Khloe-Kardashian-Infamous-True-Necklace-feat-01.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Ashley-Jared-Christmas.jpg?crop=0px%2C84px%2C3150px%2C1786px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/prince-harry-prenup.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/jennifer-lopez-engagement-ring.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gwen-Stefani-The-Voice-Promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C37px%2C1850px%2C1850px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_editorial_10494437ak.jpg?crop=0px%2C82px%2C2769px%2C1571px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_editorial_10493811em.jpg?crop=0px%2C146px%2C3150px%2C1784px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/alex-rodriguez-anne-wojcicki.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hannah-brown-ashley-iaconetti.jpg?crop=0px%2C25px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/jennifer-lopez-engagement-ring.png?resize=860%2C552", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Life", "Style Magazine"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/jennifer-lopez-engagement-ring-149958/", "title": "Jennifer Lopez's Engagement Ring \u2014 Alex Rodriguez Drops $3 Million!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Her love don't cost a thing \u2014 but that didn't stop Alex Rodriguez from splurging on Jennifer Lopez's engagement ring.
