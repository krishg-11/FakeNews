Jackman even described the process that goes into the filming of shirtless scenes, which he said involves drinking ten liters of water a day in the months leading up to the scenes, which he said are accomplished through dehydration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of unbelievable to me, what I did for seventeen years,\u201d Jackman revealed. \u201cThe first one, I thought you could get into shape in three weeks. The director pushed all the \u2018shirt off\u2019 scenes to the very end.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou stop drinking water about 30 hours before you shoot,\u201d Jackman said, explaining the process. \u201cYou lose ten pounds of water weight.\u201d\n\nBut now that that\u2019s over, Jackman is already enjoying himself.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m eating and loving it,\u201d Jackman told Colbert. \u201cSometimes waking up at two in the morning just to have breakfast cereal, and then go back to bed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith it still in my lap,\u201d he added.\n\nOne of us! One of us! One of us!\n\nLogan is in theaters now.\n\nEnjoyed this article?
