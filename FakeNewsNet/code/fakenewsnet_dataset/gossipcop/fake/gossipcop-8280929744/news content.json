And then she went on to raise what she apparently considers to be the burning question here: Are women who are getting harassed \u2018asking for it\u2019?\u201d\n\nAfter playing a clip of the comments \u2014 for which Karan has since apologized, telling the Associated Press they are \u201cnot representative of how I feel or what I believe\u201d \u2014 Kelly turned the focus to her interview with one of Weinstein\u2019s accusers, TV journalist Lauren Sivan, who on Monday\u2019s episode told Kelly about her \u201cdisgusting\u201d experience with Weinstein. \u201cWeirdly, I never thought to ask Lauren whether her skirt brought on that [restuarant] vestibule incident because her outfit is totally irrelevant \u2014 and most rational people know that,\u201d said Kelly.\n\nQuestioning Karan\u2019s statement, Kelly challenged her \u201cwrong\u201d thinking: \u201cThere are laws in this country. Laws. I don\u2019t give a damn if a woman shows up in a bikini to the office. That doesn\u2019t invite or make it okay for her superior to harass her. It makes it okay for her boss to say, \u2018Go home and change.\u2019 That\u2019s it. The truth is sexual harassment has nothing to do with wardrobe; it has to do with power and control and sexual proclivities that a superior chooses not to reign in. How insulting, by the way, to men, as well? Like they are a bunch of animals who cannot behave themselves if a woman shows part of her thigh, right? This attitude of blaming women for their own harassment is actually one of the reasons women choose not to come forward after they get harassed because they fear victim shaming.\u201d\n\nKelly continued: \u201cHow about we not pile on, Donna? How about we use this moment to encourage women to find their own voices, despite the risks and to stand up for themselves \u2014 which is hard enough, without rich, powerful, well-connected fashion moguls lecturing them on their fashion choices.\u201d\n\nThen came Kelly\u2019s kicker: \u201cAnd speaking of fashion choices, here\u2019s one for you: I\u2019m done with Donna Karan.\u201d\n\nDespite her dismissive message, Kelly invited Karan on the show for \u201can honest discussion about how [Karan] really feels,\u201d adding, \u201cIf she\u2019s really sorry, if she really was taken out of context, if she really doesn\u2019t believe that way, explain those comments.\u201d\n\nWith her comments Tuesday, Kelly joined a growing list of celebrities speaking out against Weinstein, whose scandal erupted following an Oct. 5 New York Times expos\u00e9 alleging the movie mogul has been sexually harassing women for three decades. Weinstein has since been fired by The Weinstein Company and apologized for \u201cthe way I\u2019ve behaved with colleagues in the past\u201d in a statement to the Times. On Tuesday, a report posted by the New Yorker alleged more sexual misconduct claims, including assault, against Weinstein, which he also denied.\n\nWatch Kelly\u2019s segment in the video above.
