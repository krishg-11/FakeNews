And this time it was none other than Morrone, the step-daughter of Hollywood acting legend Al Pacino.\n\nDaughter of actors Maximo Morrone and Lucile Sola, Morrone, has been romantically linked to DiCaprio for several months now. Rumors of the two being together first started in the middle of December, when DiCaprio was seen leaving her house. They have been spotted together numerous times ever since.\n\nSola, 38, has been dating 77-year-old Al Pacino for over 8 years, making him Morrone\u2019s de facto stepfather.\n\nREAL LIFE. REAL NEWS. REAL VOICES Help us tell more of the stories that matter from voices that too often remain unheard. Support Journal Post\n\nDiCaprio and Morrone were seen enjoying the show at Coachella together. While Morrone was dressed normally, the Titanic actor attempted to be incognito by wearing a large hoodie and baseball cap. The two cuddled and kissed throughout the show.\n\nAfterwards, they lounged on the grass outside a tent\u2026 with DiCaprio eating while Morrone was lying down with her head in his lap.\n\nThe pair were also seen at the Neon Carnival and Rihanna\u2019s FentyxPuma party. Before Coachella, they were last seen together in late March at breakfast in West Hollywood. In February, the two were spotted at Ellen Degeneres\u2019 birthday party in LA together. And in January, the couple went to Colorado together with Tobey Maguire.\n\nMorrone has worked as a model, appearing on the cover of Vogue Turkey and walking for Moschino\u2019s 2017 resort collection. She is now working her way into acting. She appeared in James Franco\u2019s Bukowski and in Death Wish, starring Bruce Willis.\n\nLeonardo has been known to exclusively date younger women (usually supermodels) in the past: Kristen Zang, Amber Valletta, Helena Christensen, Naomi Campbell, Gisele Bundchen, Bar Rafaeli, Blake Lively and Erin Heatherton are just some of the names in Leo\u2019s little black book.", "images":
