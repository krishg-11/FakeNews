After promoting the reality competition on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon last week, the singer appeared on NBC's The Today Show Tuesday (Mar. 7) to give morning viewers a taste of her fighting spirit.\n\nWhile sitting down with Today's co-anchors Willie Geist and Carson Daly, the singer -- who was appropriately displayed on screen with the headline \"This Girl Is Still On Fire\" -- discussed motherhood, her singing career, and how they have influenced her judging role on The Voice. Both hosts were intrigued by the \"girl crush\" between Keys and her fellow coach, Gwen Stefani, even comparing their connection to the bromance of Blake Shelton and Adam Levine. But perhaps the most notable thing Keys said about her relationship with her fellow female coach is that it's even stronger than the one Stefani has with Shelton.\n\nWith a laugh and grin from ear to ear, the \"In Common\" songstress joked \"we love each other more than Blake and Gwen love each other, straight up!\" Shelton and Stefani -- who have been dating for about 16 months -- have been a guilty pleasure for viewers, as their fairytale romance is on full display each episode, especially this season.\n\nKeys described her working chemistry with Gwen as \"amazing\" due to their long friendship. The singer had nothing but positive things to say about her experience as a judge calling it \"fun\" and boasting about the love that all the coaches share for one another.\n\nWatch the interview below:", "images": ["http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/alicia-keys-the-voice-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://assets.billboard.com/assets/1575555338/images/Billboard-white.svg?58e792d77f90a4008557", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/magazine_cover/public/media/Alicia-Keys-bb28-2019-jkl-billboard-400.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/article_main_image/public/media/alicia-keys-the-voice-2017-billboard-1548.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/alicia-keys-the-voice-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Da'Shan Smith"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7717050/alicia-keys-gwen-stefani-relationship-blake-shelton-the-voice-today-show-interview-video", "title": "Alicia Keys Says She Loves Gwen Stefani More Than Blake Shelton Does: Watch", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "title": "Alicia Keys Says She Loves Gwen Stefani More Than Blake Shelton on 'Today': Watch", "description": "Alicia Keys appears on 'The Today Show' and confesses her love for Gwen Stefani while promoting 'The Voice.'", "og": {"title": "Alicia Keys Says She Loves Gwen Stefani More Than Blake Shelton Does: Watch", "description": "Alicia Keys appears on 'The Today Show' and confesses her love for Gwen Stefani while promoting 'The Voice.'", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/alicia-keys-the-voice-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "width": 1548, "height": 1024, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7717050/alicia-keys-gwen-stefani-relationship-blake-shelton-the-voice-today-show-interview-video", "site_name": "Billboard", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7717050/alicia-keys-gwen-stefani-relationship-blake-shelton-the-voice-today-show-interview-video", "title": "Alicia Keys Says She Loves Gwen Stefani More Than Blake Shelton Does: Watch", "description": "Alicia Keys appears on 'The Today Show' and confesses her love for Gwen Stefani while promoting 'The Voice.'", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/alicia-keys-the-voice-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "site": "@billboard"}, "sailthru.title": "Alicia Keys Says She Loves Gwen Stefani More Than Blake Shelton Does: Watch", "sailthru.description": "Alicia Keys appears on 'The Today Show' and confesses her love for Gwen Stefani while promoting 'The Voice.'", "sailthru.author": "Da'Shan Smith", "sailthru.vertical": "Pop", "sailthru.tags": "Alicia Keys,Gwen Stefani,Blake Shelton,Hip-Hop,Pop,Television", "sailthru.date": "2017-03-07 13:25:36"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1488911136.0, "source": "http://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
