Step back!\u201d one of the girls shouts. The other then yells, \u201cIt\u2019s a tarantula, right mom?\u201d\n\nShowing her laidback Australian attitude towards creepy crawlies, Kidman then turns the camera to face her, showing fans she has the spider trapped inside a glass.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m having to take care of this spider, help,\u201d Kidman says at the end of the video.\n\nDespite getting caught, the spider was very lucky as the star opted to release it rather than kill it.\n\n\u201cHouse guest! Catch and release\u2026 spider released unharmed and healthy \u2764\ufe0fHappy Sunday,\u201d Kidman captioned the image.\n\nImage zoom Nicole Kidman Steve Granitz/WireImage\n\nInterestingly, there\u2019s a reason Kidman is so comfortable around bugs \u2014 she eats them.\n\nBack in January, Kidman ate a four-course meal of bugs with chopsticks on Vanity Fair\u2019s \u201cSecret Talent Theatre.\u201d\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban Reminisce on 12th Wedding Anniversary: \u2018Feels Like It Was Yesterday\u2019\n\nAfter eating her first course of hornworms, Kidman says \u201cTwo billion people in the world eat bugs and I\u2019m one of them.\u201d\n\nShe then went on to eat mealworms, crickets, and grasshoppers for her last course.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/wbswacvx.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0ecfb7e275332c72a5d7c98a0963061b?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/nicole-kidman15.jpg"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/wbswacvx.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Robyn Merrett"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/nicole-kidman-captures-spider-children-screaming-video/", "title": "Nicole Kidman Captures A Spider From Her Swimming Pool", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Celebrities,News,Nicole Kidman", "news_keywords": "Celebrities,News,Nicole Kidman", "description": "Nicole Kidman captured a spider from her swimming pool while her children scream in the background", "og": {"title": "Nicole Kidman Bravely Captures Tarantula as Her Horrified Children Look On: 'Get Back, Mom!'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/movies/nicole-kidman-captures-spider-children-screaming-video/", "description": "Nicole Kidman captured a spider from her swimming pool while her children scream in the background.", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/wbswacvx.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/movies/nicole-kidman-captures-spider-children-screaming-video/", "description": "Nicole Kidman captured a spider from her swimming pool while her children scream in the background", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/wbswacvx.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/movies/nicole-kidman-captures-spider-children-screaming-video/", "title": "Nicole Kidman Bravely Captures Tarantula as Her Horrified Children Look On: 'Get Back, Mom!'", "description": "Nicole Kidman captured a spider from her swimming pool while her children scream in the background", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/wbswacvx.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://people.com", "summary": ""}
