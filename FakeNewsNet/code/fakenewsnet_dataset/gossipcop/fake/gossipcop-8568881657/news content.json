We\u2019re hearing she\u2019s discussed retiring to have a \u2018regular life.\u2019\n\nEveryone knew that Kylie Jenner\u2019s life was going to change after her alleged pregnancy, but no one thought it would go this far! The 20-year-old, who practically grew up in front of the cameras as a star of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, has gone into hiding, which has her thinking about her future. \u201cShe wants to be out of the spotlight right now, and she just wants to focus on getting ready for the baby,\u201d a source close to the Kardashians EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. \u201cKylie has even talked about wanting to be out of the public eye permanently, and focusing fully on being a mom and businesswoman.\u201d\n\nWhat? No more Kylie on our television screens? Is this real life? Well, before Kylie\u2019s fans start creating change.org petitions to demand Kylie appear on 10 more seasons of KUWTK, her family isn\u2019t really buying this \u201cretirement\u201d talk. \u201cEveryone is taking that with a pinch of salt,\u201d the source tells HollywoodLife.com. \u201cKris [Jenner] thinks there\u2019s no way Kylie is ready for a peaceful, quiet, regular life just yet, and that once she\u2019s had the baby she will want to be back out there.\u201d\n\nWhether or not Kylie returns to the spotlight after she gives birth remains to be seen. Speaking of the spotlight, fans shouldn\u2019t expect Kylie to resume her old habits of posing for social media snaps and Instagram pics. She has shied away from the camera for months, and as a source EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com, it\u2019s because she lives in \u201cconstant fear\u201d that of possibly suffering the same kind of fat-shaming that Kim Kardashian, 37, suffered when she was pregnant with North West, 4. Kylie can\u2019t stand the thought of thousands upon thousands of Internet commenters saying mean things about her body, so she\u2019d rather keep it all under wraps until she gives birth.\n\nThough, it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea if Kylie decided to undergo a career change, post-baby. Kris told WWD that Kylie Cosmetics made $420 million in retail sales since its official launch, and it was expected to make $386 million in 2017, which was a 25% increase from the prior year. With Est\u00e9e Lauder Cos. Inc.-owned Tom Ford Beauty reaching revenues of $500 million after a decade, Kylie\u2019s become a mega-makeup-mogul. Perhaps \u201cretiring\u201d at 20 to focus on family and business isn\u2019t such a farfetched idea?\n\nWhat do you think, HollywoodLifers? Should Kylie Jenner retire from television and focus on being a mom and a successful businesswoman?", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/nick-cannon-eminem-hailie-mariah-carey-diss-track-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/ryay-j-love-hip-hop-hollywood-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/kylie-wants-to-retire-from-celebrity-life-permanently-ftr.jpg", "https://i2.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_editorial_8289281f.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/chris-brown-royalty-sweet-new-pic-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/jason_brow.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/nup_189287_2756.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F01%2F07%2Fis-kylie-jenner-retiring-celebrity-spotlight-pregnancy-baby%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2936591&comment_count=4", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/captain-marvel.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/fendi-scented-bags.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_511880716.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/kylie-wants-to-retire-from-celebrity-life-permanently-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jason Brow", "Music", "Sports Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/01/07/is-kylie-jenner-retiring-celebrity-spotlight-pregnancy-baby/", "title": "Kylie Wants To Retire From Celebrity Life \u2018Permanently\u2019 \u2014 But Is Her Family Taking Her Seriously?", "meta_data": {"description": "Kylie Jenner -- retiring?
