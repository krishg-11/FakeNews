{"url": "www.journalpost.com/entertainment/celeb/jennifer-lopez-marriage/", "text": "Jennifer Lopez has spoken out about her relationship with Alex Rodriguez and where it is headed in the future. The singer fully believes in the power of positive thinking.\n\nLopez recently released a new song, Us, which she dedicated to Rodriguez at a concert in Minneapolis. She has been dating Rodriguez since March 2017, and the two have since blended their families together as well. Both Rodriguez and Lopez have two kids each from earlier marriages: he has a 13 year old daughter Natasha and a 9 year old daughter named Ella, and she has twins Max and Emme. However, as the couple\u2019s relationship progresses, fans cannot help but wonder when J-Lo will get married, and whether she is already engaged in secret.\n\nWhile speaking to Harper\u2019s Bazaar, Lopez said, \u201cI do believe in marriage. And I would love to grow old with somebody in a committed relationship. But I\u2019m not forcing anything right now. It\u2019s good, it\u2019s healthy; we communicate well. We understand each other\u2019s lives in a way that most other people couldn\u2019t. We both entered the public eye in our early 20s and overachieved right from the start. And that affects every dynamic in your life, from your family to your work to your relationships. We have a similar makeup.\u201d\n\nPart of Lopez\u2019s secret to success is an internalization of positive thoughts and happy mantras that get her through the day. A few of the ones lying on various furniture around her home are \u2018no limits but the sky\u2018, \u2018life is short, live your dream\u2018 and one of the most important, \u2018I am youthful and timeless at every age\u2018.\n\nREAL LIFE. REAL NEWS. REAL VOICES Help us tell more of the stories that matter from voices that too often remain unheard. Support Journal Post\n\nLopez, who is known for her perfect skin and body which she has maintained even at the age of 48, said, \u201cAffirmations are so important. I am youthful and timeless. I tell myself that every day, a few times a day. It sounds like clich\u00e9d bullshit, but it\u2019s not: Age is all in your mind. Look at Jane Fonda.\u201d\n\nDuring her interview, Lopez also talked about the #MeToo movement. She said that while she does not feel she has been harassed in the same way as the other women that have been coming forward with claims for a while now, she has definitely had her share of uncomfortable experiences when men in the industry thought she would do anything for a job.\n\nShe explained, \u201cI haven\u2019t been abused in the way some women have. But have I been told by a director to take off my shirt and show my boobs? Yes, I have. But did I do it? No, I did not. When I did speak up, I was terrified. I remember my heart beating out of my chest, thinking, \u2018What did I do? This man is hiring me!\u2019 It was one of my first movies. But in my mind I knew the behavior wasn\u2019t right. It could have gone either way for me. But I think ultimately the Bronx in me was like, \u2018Nah, we\u2019re not having it.\u2019\u201d\n\nJennifer Lopez\u2019s Us was released in February 2018.", "images":
