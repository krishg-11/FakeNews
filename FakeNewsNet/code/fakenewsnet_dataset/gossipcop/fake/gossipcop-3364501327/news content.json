According to National Enquirer, Beatty is producing the remake and has chosen DiCaprio to play his then-role, a sexed up hairdresser.\n\nA source tells National Enquirer that \"the idea's got [Beatty] bubbling, and he's convinced Leo's a natural\" to wear his \"sex-soaked costumes.\" In the original movie, Beatty played a hairdresser who slept with his wealthy female clients.\n\nHowever, Gossip Cop has learned that the report is simply not true. An insider close to DiCaprio tells the site that DiCaprio is not in talks to star in \"Shampoo\" reboot. In addition, an insider related to Beatty tells the site that \"the filmmaker isn't working on a remake of the comedy.\" Gossip Cop goes on saying that \"DiCaprio tends to gravitate towards more serious fare. In fact, the only film on his entire resume that might be considered a comedy is 'The Wolf of Wall Street', which had plenty of dramatic elements as well.\"\n\nDiCaprio, who is also known as an environmentalist, earned critical acclaims for his performance in \"The Wolf of Wall Street\", \"Django Unchained\", \"Blood Diamond\" and \"Revolutionary Road\". The actor nabbed an Oscar for his role as Hugh Glass in semi-biographical western film \"The Revenant\".
