And, no, we did not mean to write Kristen Stewart all you Twilight superfans.\n\nRob and his new cutie chanteuse, whose real name is Tahliah Barnett, have been quietly dating for about a month, according to a report, with Rob doing what he does best and flying under the radar with this major coupling news.\n\nThe biggest sighting of the two together was walking around NYC and even then they were sure to keep a distance from one another.\n\nRob is a pro.\n\nAs everyone in the whole entire world knows, Rob was previously one half of Robsten with Miss Stewart, reigning as one of, if not the, most photographed and written about celebrity couples in the world for a few years, much to their mutual and very visible displeasure. The two were the romantic leads in a giant movie franchise, traveling the world together and walking red carpets nonstop for roughly four years. They even got a dog.\n\nThen, Kristen landed the role of Snow White in Snow White and the Huntsman, directed by Rupert Sanders \u2013 And we all know how that turned out!\n\nLucky for Rob, his new gal pal also seems to shun the spotlight.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been taking her on dates for the last month or so, and has even flown her out to stay with him in New York. He also loves going to her gigs,\u201d a source told UK newspaper The Sun.\n\n\u201cThe main thing for Tahliah is that the relationship remains low key. She wants to be known for her music, not just as \u2018Robert Pattinson\u2019s girlfriend\u2019.\n\nThen, for reasons unknown to us, the source adds,\u201d[FKA\u2019s] worried about being bogged down by constant comparisons to Kristen.\u201d\n\nMiss Twigs is an English singer-songwriter who loves bright colors, unique clothes, and crazy and innovative hair and makeup looks. She worked as a backup dancer for the likes of Kylie Minogue, Ed Sheeran, and Taio Cruz for years before she started seriously pursuing her singing career. She is supposedly dating Robert Pattison.\n\nKristen Stewart is an American who loves jeans, canvas sneakers, and a good clean fresh face. She has always been a very serious, and very good, actress, highly in demand since her breakthrough role in Panic Room alongside Jodie Foster almost 20 years ago. She is definitely not dating Robert Pattinson.\n\nThis clearly proves that even if someone wanted to make a comparison between these girls, they would be very hard-pressed to come up with something, save their fondness for Robby.\n\nIn addition, this also proves that everyone\u2019s favorite sparkly vampire most definitely does not have a \u201ctype.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/454255114.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Felicity-Jones-Pregnant.jpg?crop=0px%2C76px%2C2085px%2C2085px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/meghan-markle-prince-harry-kate-middleton-prince-william-reunite.png?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jamie-Otis-Claps-Back-at-Mom-Shaming-Sometimes.jpg?crop=0px%2C294px%2C3857px%2C2183px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/an-unexpected-killer-larry-swartz-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2550px%2C1444px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/477021283.jpg?w=1180&h=530&crop=1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Biel-Pushed-Justin-Timberlake-Make-a-Public-Statement-PDA-Scandal-Promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/90-DF-Jesse-Meester-Reacts-to-Avery-and-Angelas-Tell-All-Feud.jpg?crop=0px%2C39px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/90-Day-Fiance-Star-Nicole-Jimenos-BF-01.jpg?crop=53px%2C39px%2C1906px%2C1080px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/454255114.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Baby-to-Age-4-See-Baby-Chanel-Nicole-Transformation-Over-the-Years-landing-01.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C2000px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Meghan-King-Edmonds-Ready-to-Date-After-Jim-Edmonds-Divorce.jpg?crop=0px%2C78px%2C2770px%2C1572px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/princess-beatrice-cancels-engagement-party-amid-prince-andrew-scandal.jpg?crop=0px%2C428px%2C3516px%2C1990px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tara-Reid-Transformation-Promo.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jesse-Meester-Tom-Brooks-Bonded-Over-Darcey-Silva-Drama-01.jpg?crop=2px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Olivia-Jade-and-Isabella-Gianulli-Dreading-Holidays-Amid-Mom-Lori-Loughlin-Legal-Battle-01.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Celebs-With-the-Most-Outrageous-Demands-in-Hollywood-Promo.jpg?resize=90%2C90"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/454255114.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chris Spargo"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/robert-pattinson-dating-singer-fka-twigs-dashing-dreams-of-a-robsten-reunion-42369/", "title": "Robert Pattinson Dating Singer FKA Twigs, Dashing Dreams of a Robsten Reunion", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Robert Pattinson is young, rich, attractive, and very, very famous, so it should come as no surprise that the British Lothario has reportedly snagged himself a pretty little lady friend of recent, \u2026", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Robert Pattinson Dating Singer FKA Twigs, Dashing Dreams of a Robsten Reunion -
