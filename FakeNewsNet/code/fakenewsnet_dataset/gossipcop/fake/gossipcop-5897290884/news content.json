Katy Perry, aka Taylor Swift\u2019s number one pop rival.\n\nALBUM COMING JUNE 30 pic.twitter.com/zHJpBRdpqq \u2014 Calvin Harris (@CalvinHarris) May 9, 2017\n\nSwift and Perry have publicly traded barbs for years, ever since Swift sat down with Rolling Stone in 2014 to explain who the venom-filled lyrics of her song Bad Blood were about.\n\n\u201cFor years, I was never sure if we were friends or not,\u201d Swift said.\n\n\u201cShe would come up to me at awards shows and say something and walk away, and I would think, \u2018Are we friends, or did she just give me the harshest insult of my life?\u2019 [Then] she did something so horrible. I was like, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re just straight-up enemies.\u2019 And it wasn\u2019t even about a guy! It had to do with business,\u201d she added.\n\nThe business thing came down to each singer\u2019s dancers for their tour.\n\n\u201cShe basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour. She tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me. And I\u2019m surprisingly nonconfrontational \u2014 you would not believe how much I hate conflict. So now I have to avoid her. It\u2019s awkward, and I don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\nA day after Swift\u2019s comments, Katy Perry tweeted a reference to Mean Girls.\n\nWatch out for the Regina George in sheep's clothing... \u2014 Katy Perry (@katyperry) September 9, 2014\n\nDuring last year\u2019s This Is What You Came For songwriting feud, Harris even made it clear whose side he was on when he tweeted in regards to Swift: \u201cI know you\u2019re off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like Katy ETC but I\u2019m not that guy, sorry. I won\u2019t allow it.\u201d\n\nSo here\u2019s how you get back at your shady ex-girlfriend when you\u2019re a millionaire music producer: Write a ready-made hit for her biggest pop rival. Bad Blood 2.0, anybody?", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/spp-api/v1/template/?path=components.nav-primary&t_domain=news.com.au&t_product=newscomau",
