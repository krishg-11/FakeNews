The lot includes a slice of brandy-infused fruitcake from the 2011 marriage of Harry\u2019s brother William to Kate Middleton (with an estimated price of between six and eight hundred dollars), and one from the wedding of the boys\u2019 parents, Prince Charles and Diana (eight to twelve hundred dollars), sold with a paper doily and an envelope, addressed to its original recipients and marked with Queen Elizabeth\u2019s royal stamp. There is a slice from Charles\u2019s wedding to his second wife, Camilla Parker Bowles; another from the wedding of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, in 1986; and, at a relative bargain rate of three to five hundred dollars, one from the union of Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips, in 1973. In the years since these confections were baked, their layers of marzipan may have turned from yellow to a dingy ochre, but the cake itself, loaded with sugar and spirits and dried fruit, is otherwise impressively preserved.\n\nElizabeth and Philip\u2019s wedding, in 1947, featured a four-tiered cake weighing five hundred pounds.

Since medieval times, all special occasions in England, from Christmas to christenings, had been celebrated with fruit cakes, which were optimally suited to an era before refrigeration. (As one modern-day food-safety specialist noted, \u201cYou are unlikely to see mould on a fruit cake for a very long time.\u201d) Raffald\u2019s innovation was to cover \u201cbride cake,\u201d as wedding cake was then called, in a layer of marzipan, followed by a bright white shell of the cement-like substance that came to be known as royal icing. This double coating made cakes that were good to look at but not necessarily to eat. Guests were left, one nineteenth-century baker remarked, with \u201ca thick layer of white sugar which nobody cared about; a medium layer of almond paste, which everybody wished for, and did not always get; and an immense quantity of cake of which many only ate a few crumbs.\u201d\n\nQueen Victoria\u2019s cake for her wedding, in 1840, was the first to become a national obsession, an extension of the public\u2019s fascination with the young queen herself. It was baked in a vast single layer\u2014\u201ca great beast . . . some ten feet in circumference,\u201d as one observer put it. On top were figurines of Victoria and her betrothed, Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, wearing Roman dress, and also statues of turtle doves, Cupids, and one of Victoria\u2019s beloved dogs. The cake\u2019s picture was displayed in every print shop in London; in the weeks before the wedding as many as twenty-one thousand people visited the bakery on Bond Street, where a policeman was standing guard. Eighteen years later, the wedding of Victoria\u2019s daughter Vicky, to Prince Frederick William of Prussia, featured the first multi-tiered royal-wedding cake. It stood seven feet tall, with elaborate sugar busts of the bride, the groom, and the bride\u2019s parents, plus various naked Cupids, festoons of orange blossom, and allegorical statues representing innocence and wisdom.\n\nQueen Victoria\u2019s wedding cake, from 1840, was the first to become a national obsession.

When Elizabeth and Philip were married, in 1947, wartime rationing was still in place, and there was something almost masochistic in the way the public revelled in the thought of the couple\u2019s four-tiered \u201cmasterpiece\u201d confection, which weighed five hundred pounds, was stuffed with currants and raisins donated by the Girl Guides of Australia, and featured scenes from the couple\u2019s lives, including of Philip\u2019s favorite sports: athletics, cricket, and sailing. (In 2015, a piece of this cake, still wrapped in its original baking parchment, was sold at auction for five hundred pounds.) For Kate and William\u2019s wedding, the groom asked for a special extra cake of melted dark chocolate and broken rich-tea biscuits, but the couple\u2019s main wedding cake would not have looked out of place on a Victorian banqueting table. Its maker, the luxury-cake designer Fiona Cairns, has said that she was given a \u201cclear brief\u201d that the cake must not be \u201costentatious or grand.\u201d Yet it still featured eight tiers of fruitcake rising more than a metre high and weighing a hundred kilos and decorated with seventeen types of sugar-paste flowers, each chosen by Kate for its symbolic meaning, including thistles for Scotland and lily of the valley for humility. The request for chocolate, and for modesty, looked like tiny gestures of rebellion from a prince who might secretly yearn to break free of his grandmother\u2019s rituals but is too polite to do so.", "images": ["https://media.newyorker.com/photos/590951ae019dfc3494e9db73/4:3/w_620,c_limit/Luke-Barr-book.jpg", "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5afb018f7295c82c7924c6ca/master/w_727,c_limit/Wilson-Royal-Wedding-Cake-2.jpg", "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5afc4b3ec9d79f2c7fa1e907/16:9/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/wilson-royal-wedding-cake.jpg", "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59095c54019dfc3494e9f753/4:3/w_620,c_limit/Food-Imagination.jpg", "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5af45ec37fb33744eca3b053/master/w_80,c_limit/Royal-Wedding-Icon-051018.jpg", "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59096ef01c7a8e33fb38e824/4:3/w_620,c_limit/Wilson-Reading-About-People-Eating.jpg", "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5afc4b3ec9d79f2c7fa1e907/master/w_727,c_limit/wilson-royal-wedding-cake.jpg", "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5909727febe912338a377420/4:3/w_620,c_limit/Twilley-Teaching-Grownups-How-to-Eat.jpg", "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5afb018fdda2d225595b0dbb/master/w_727,c_limit/Wilson-Royal-Wedding-Cake-3.jpg", "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5afb019052bc692d8918c70a/master/w_727,c_limit/Wilson-Royal-Wedding-Cake-1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5afc4b3ec9d79f2c7fa1e907/16:9/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/wilson-royal-wedding-cake.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bee Wilson", "Joshua Rothman", "Dexter Filkins", "David Rohde", "Masha Gessen", "Jiayang Fan", "Nicola Twilley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-gastronomy/prince-harry-and-meghan-markles-wedding-cake-breaks-with-centuries-of-royal-tradition", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s Wedding Cake Breaks with Centuries of Royal Tradition", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no,width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1", "id": "5afaffc85474413779cf5a98", "parsely-metadata": "{\"id\":\"5afaffc85474413779cf5a98\",\"issueDate\":\"\",\"dek\":\"Unlike the monumental confections of yore, which were so solid that brides needed a special saw to make the first cut, the couple\u2019s cake will be designed to eat, not to keep.\",\"section\":\"Annals of Gastronomy\",\"url\":\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-gastronomy/prince-harry-and-meghan-markles-wedding-cake-breaks-with-centuries-of-royal-tradition\",\"image\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"contentUrl\":\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-gastronomy/prince-harry-and-meghan-markles-wedding-cake-breaks-with-centuries-of-royal-tradition\",\"url\":\"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5afc4b3ec9d79f2c7fa1e907/4:3/w_960,c_limit/wilson-royal-wedding-cake.jpg\"}}", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "Bee Wilson writes about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s wedding cake, baked by Claire Ptak, of the hip East London shop Violet Bakery, which sharply breaks with centuries of fruitcake tradition.", "keywords": "prince harry,wedding cake,royal weddings,meghan markle", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1081530898", "fb": {"app_id": 1147169538698836}, "news_keywords": "Culture, Annals of Gastronomy, prince harry, wedding cake, royal weddings, meghan markle", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The New Yorker", "image": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5afc4b3ec9d79f2c7fa1e907/16:9/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/wilson-royal-wedding-cake.jpg", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s Wedding Cake Breaks with Centuries of Royal Tradition", "description": "Unlike the monumental confections of yore, which were so solid that brides needed a special saw to make the first cut, the couple\u2019s cake will be designed to eat, not to keep.", "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-gastronomy/prince-harry-and-meghan-markles-wedding-cake-breaks-with-centuries-of-royal-tradition", "type": "article"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@NewYorker", "domain": "www.newyorker.com", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s Wedding Cake Breaks with Centuries of Royal Tradition", "description": "Unlike the monumental confections of yore, which were so solid that brides needed a special saw to make the first cut, the couple\u2019s cake will be designed to eat, not to keep.", "image": {"src": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5afc4b3ec9d79f2c7fa1e907/16:9/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/wilson-royal-wedding-cake.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}}, "pubdate": 20180516}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.newyorker.com", "summary": ""}
