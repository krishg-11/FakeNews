We\u2019re living in an incredible moment in time, but it\u2019s also a time where truth can easily get distorted into \u201calternative facts\u201d \ud83d\ude09 So we want to share the truth so you know that if you didn\u2019t read it here then it\u2019s most certainly fiction.\n\nWe have lovingly chosen to separate as a couple. We fell deeply in love so many years ago and have had a magical journey together. Absolutely nothing has changed about how much we love one another, but love is a beautiful adventure that is taking us on different paths for now. There are no secrets nor salacious events at the root of our decision \u2014 just two best-friends realizing it\u2019s time to take some space and help each other live the most joyous, fulfilled lives as possible. We are still a family and will always be loving dedicated parents to Everly. We won\u2019t be commenting beyond this, and we thank you all in advance for respecting our family\u2019s privacy. Sending lots of love to everyone, Chan&Jenna.\u201d\n\nThe actors, both 37, have one child together \u2014 daughter Everly \u2014 who will turn 5 in May.\n\nThe couple most recently attended the Kids\u2019 Choice Awards together where Tatum hit the stage to promote his new animated movie Smallfoot.\n\nThey first met on the set of their 2006 movie Step Up and began dating shortly after before tying the knot in 2009.\n\nImage zoom Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan have split. The last attended a red carpet together in November (pictured) Greg Doherty/Getty\n\nBuzz about a split began when Dewan Tatum attended the annual Vanity Fair Oscars after-party solo, but she told ET at the bash that Tatum was on daddy duty and \u201cso happy to have a night off.\u201d\n\nAnd in mid-March the former couple shared sweet snaps from a face painting session with their daughter. \u201cWhen you fall asleep around a toddler,\u201d Dewan Tatum captioned a silly shot of Tatum before sharing a solo selfie of her own look.\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

It is a great fit as long as you are growing together, and I think up until this point we\u2019ve really grown together. Even if one starts to grow, the other catches up and vice versa.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Dave Benett/WireImage\n\nDewan Tatum said while they always made sure to make time for one another, they still had days where they didn\u2019t get along.\n\n\u201cBut I think a couple needs to be conscious and to want to do the work and be willing to look at the parts of you that need work. Both of us have been pretty aware and willing to do that,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had the same values. But we\u2019re not perfect! Are you kidding? We fight like other couples, we disagree about things, we have days where we don\u2019t really like each other.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Channing Tatum & Jenna Dewan \u2018Have Lovingly Chosen to Separate\u2019 After Nearly 9 Years of Marriage\n\nIn December, Tatum wished his wife a happy birthday with a heartfelt Instagram post.\n\n\u201cThis creature is one more year beautiful. The transformation she invoked this year has been something they only write about in books of fairytale and magic. Your strength and grace ever-evolving,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBy doing so you make everything around you grow- everything. And I am so very grateful for your lessons. Happy life day my love.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/channing-tatum2.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/channing-tatum.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/magic-mike-6.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/editorial-franchise-exclusive.png", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ee4324027713f6d75a36d144a4e4ed7c?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/channing-tatum.jpg"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/magic-mike-6.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kara Warner", "Julie Jordan"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/channing-tatum-jenna-dewan-split-nearly-nine-years-marriage/", "title": "Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan Split After 9 Years of Marriage", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Channing Tatum,Couples,Exclusive,Jenna Dewan,Movie Celebrities,Movie News,News", "news_keywords": "Channing Tatum,Couples,Exclusive,Jenna Dewan,Movie Celebrities,Movie News,News", "description": "The couple first met on the set of their 2006 movie\u00a0Step Up, and began dating shortly after", "og": {"title": "Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan Split After Nearly 9 Years of Marriage", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/movies/channing-tatum-jenna-dewan-split-nearly-nine-years-marriage/", "description": "The couple first met on the set of their 2006 movie\u00a0Step Up, and began dating shortly after", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/magic-mike-6.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/movies/channing-tatum-jenna-dewan-split-nearly-nine-years-marriage/", "description": "The couple first met on the set of their 2006 movie\u00a0Step Up, and began dating shortly after", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/magic-mike-6.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/movies/channing-tatum-jenna-dewan-split-nearly-nine-years-marriage/", "title": "Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan Split After Nearly 9 Years of Marriage", "description": "The couple first met on the set of their 2006 movie\u00a0Step Up, and began dating shortly after", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/magic-mike-6.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://people.com", "summary": ""}
