Along with a close friend from Gunnedah, the pastoral town where she grew up, Kerr set out to experience what for many is the draw of New Zealand: to escape and explore, to get a little lost and, in the process, get a little found. They slept in a tent. Swam in natural hot springs. Hiked terrain so raw and depopulated and expansive it felt as if they were the first humans to discover it. Kerr didn\u2019t know it at the time, but her life would change significantly in the years that followed, thanks largely to her enviable genetic gifts: the long pale legs, the shimmering doe eyes and, most famously, the pert, dimpled cheeks that have made her one of the highest paid, most recognizable models in the world. Modeling, for Kerr, has been its own sort of adventure, one she will be the first to acknowledge as a stroke of good fortune not to be taken for granted. \u201cStill, that backpacking trip, just having that freedom, was one of the best times in my life,\u201d Kerr recently reflected. \u201cEver since, I\u2019ve wanted to get back to New Zealand.\u201d\n\nFor seven months, beginning last December, Kerr, 29, got her wish. She spent the majority of her nonworking time in Wellington , New Zealand\u2019s capital, where her husband, Orlando Bloom , was filming \u201cThe Hobbit,\u201d Peter Jackson \u2019s two-part prequel to the epic \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d trilogy, the films that first made Bloom a star a decade ago. Wellington \u2014 or \u201cWellywood,\u201d as it\u2019s been christened since Jackson set up his studio empire in the suburb of Miramar \u2014 is one of the most remote capitals on the planet: some 28 hours by plane from London , 23 from New York, 15 from Los Angeles , 14 hours from Hong Kong and Tokyo . Of the city\u2019s many charms \u2014 its burgeoning restaurant scene, its absurdly picturesque scenery, the mellow Kiwi hospitality you experience everywhere you go \u2014 it is Wellington\u2019s physical isolation that makes it such a singular place. During the week I spent in the city, no matter what I was doing, even something as simple as sitting at a cafe sipping a flat white (New Zealand\u2019s richer version of a latte), I felt a palpable remove from the ways and rhythms of the rest of the world. (Being on the other side of the international date line helps.) So while much of Wellington could be compared to, say, Portland , Ore., or Seattle , there is the added seduction of being pleasantly unmoored, able to take in the pleasure of civilization while existing outside of it.\n\nThe circumstances of Kerr\u2019s stay in Wellington were, of course, quite different from her initial visit. She is now the mother of a cherubic young son, Flynn, 19 months, and the tent of her teen years was replaced by an airy, seaside mansion where every window looks out on Wellington Harbour. (The house, lent to the couple by one of the film\u2019s producers, happens to be where Bloom celebrated his 22nd birthday while filming \u201cTLOTR.\u201d) If she wanted to run an errand, or head to an afternoon Pilates class, a production assistant gave her a ride. Sweet perks, no question. And yet, to hear Kerr tell it, the life she and Bloom carved out in Wellington was in many ways a reminder of what existence was like before she became a celebrity, a kind of geographic escape hatch from the scrutiny of tabloids and the curious eyes of strangers. When they first arrived, for instance, they took a road trip that was reminiscent of her earlier journey: aimlessly driving around the countryside, out of reach and out of touch. \u201cWe didn\u2019t camp because Flynn\u2019s still a little young for that,\u201d Kerr told me. \u201cBut it was just the three of us, nothing to do except be with each other in this shockingly beautiful place.\u201d\n\nKerr and I were having this conversation at Wellington\u2019s Botanic Garden, a sprawling expanse of lush floral curiosities, manicured lawns and shaded labyrinthine walkways offering some of the most extraordinary views of the city. It was hard to imagine that this was the same woman who, a few months earlier, had walked the runway in a $2.5 million bra while Maroon 5 performed at the Victoria\u2019s Secret fashion show; here, in raw-denim jeans and a loose navy sweater, she seemed no different from the other health-conscious young mothers who made up most of the gardens \u2019 visitors. Kerr had come from the set of \u201cThe Hobbit,\u201d which she visited most days with Flynn when Bloom, who was reprising his role as the bow-wielding elf Legolas, was working. \u201cThere\u2019s a cafeteria where everyone eats lunch, and they\u2019re all in full makeup,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cSo you see these poor Orcs\u201d \u2014 the demonic goblin soldiers of the film \u2014 \u201ctrying to eat without ruining their costumes. For Orlando , it\u2019s easier. He just has the blond wig and the pointy ears.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/08/19/t-magazine/19well-kerr/19well-kerr-jumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/08/19/t-magazine/19well-kerr/19well-kerr-superJumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/08/19/t-magazine/19well-kerr/19well-kerr-superJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["David Amsden"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/t-magazine/miranda-kerr-goes-kiwi.html", "title": "Miranda Kerr Goes Kiwi", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "applicationName": "article", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000001686367", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/t-magazine/miranda-kerr-goes-kiwi.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/t-magazine/miranda-kerr-goes-kiwi.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000001686367"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/t-magazine/miranda-kerr-goes-kiwi.html", "title": "Miranda Kerr Goes Kiwi", "description": "To cap off an extended stay in New Zealand with her family, Miranda Kerr gives Wellington a whirl in fall\u2019s white shirts and strappy flats.
