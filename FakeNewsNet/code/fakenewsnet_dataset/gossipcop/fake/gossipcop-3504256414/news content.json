Cole\u2019s new music video for \u201cKevin\u2019s Heart,\u201d the comedian takes on the cheating scandal from September 2017 when he admitted to being unfaithful to then-eight-months pregnant wife Eniko Parrish.\n\nHart 38, plays himself as he goes through a day presumably amid the news that an unidentified person allegedly tried to extort him for a sexually suggestive video.\n\nThe J.Cole-directed visual accompaniment opens with men and women staring at and judging Hart in a supermarket as the star peruses the aisles. Then in the car, Hart hears radio hosts discussing his \u201csituation\u201d before a woman in the car next to him sends flirtatious vibes and an older woman judges him with disgust.\n\nCut to another store, Hart is looking at strollers, as a fan instructs a young boy to take a picture of them and she gets uncomfortably handsy with Hart.\n\nRELATED: Kevin Hart Opens Up About His \u2018Tough\u2019 Year After Sex Extortion Scandal\n\nImage zoom J. Cole/YouTube\n\nLastly, during a dinner, Hart receives a note from a waitress, that reads, \u201cLook at the bar,\u201d where a woman is eager to invite him over. Hart, who appears frustrated, escapes to the bathroom where a man uses the stall next to him, saying: \u201cNobody\u2019s perfect and you\u2019re only human. Learn from it, man. Learn from it.\u201d\n\nWant to keep up with the latest from PEOPLE?

I\u2019m wrong,\u201d Hart said in an interview with the Power 105.1 FM show The Breakfast Club. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond irresponsible. There\u2019s no way around it. That\u2019s Kevin Hart in his dumbest moment. That\u2019s not the finest hour of my life.
