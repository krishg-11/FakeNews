Oh my God, well they got that right!\u201d Stefani told Access Hollywood.\n\n\u201cWow, I knew I was on to something. Wow, I\u2019m gonna look really good huh? I already had scored but now I really scored,\u201d she continued.\n\nAnd even if Shelton is not this year\u2019s pick, Stefani said: \u201cI still score.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Kevin Mazur/BBMA2017/Getty\n\nThe couple has been hot and heavy since they began dating in November 2015 when they met as coaches on The Voice, not long after Shelton\u2019s divorce from fellow country crooner Miranda Lambert and Stefani\u2019s divorce from husband Gavin Rossdale.\n\nAnd they\u2019ve been inseparable ever since.\n\nWATCH: Gwen Stefani Calls Boyfriend Blake Shelton the \u2018Perfect\u2019 Sexiest Man Alive\n\nFrom red carpet appearances and on-stage performances to their undying support of one another from a distance and their sweet selfies, the pair are a match made in heaven \u2014 blending their families together, sharing holidays, and even collaborating on songs including \u201cGo Ahead and Break My Heart\u201d (off of Shelton\u2019s album, If I\u2019m Honest), and \u201cYou Make It Feel Like Christmas\u201d (the title track of Stefani\u2019s Christmas album).\n\nEven Shelton\u2019s longtime Voice costar Adam Levine previously said during a Howard Stern Show interview: \u201cThey\u2019re so in love it\u2019s disgusting.
