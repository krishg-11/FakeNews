Sources exclusively told In Touch that the longtime pals are no longer close because Matt isn\u2019t too fond of Ben\u2019s girlfriend, Lindsay Shookus. \u201c[Matt] thinks she is controlling and manipulative,\u201d the insider claimed.\n\nAside from her less redeeming qualities, Matt also believes Lindsay is \u201cbad news\u201d for Ben. \u201cShe likes to drink and Ben [who recently went to rehab] shouldn\u2019t be around that,\u201d the source said.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s unclear when Ben and Lindsay actually started seeing each other, a source told Entertainment Tonight that things got romantic after his separation from wife, Jennifer Garner. Since then, the pair have taken their relationship public as they\u2019ve been spotted going on dinner dates and grabbing coffee. Rumors even swirled that Ben introduced Lindsay to his three kids \u2014 Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6.\n\nBut as close as Lindsay and Ben are getting, Matt still isn\u2019t convinced she\u2019s the right girl for him. \u201cMatt doesn\u2019t think she measures up to Jennifer [Garner],\u201d the source revealed. \u201cMatt\u2019s bummed. He hopes Ben eventually comes to his senses.\u201d\n\nBen and Matt \u2014 whose careers both kicked off after their roles in Good Will Hunting \u2014 have been friends for more than two decades, so it\u2019s safe to say they know each other pretty well. Matt even stuck up for Ben when he was asked about the dad of three\u2019s insanely large back tattoo. \u201cIt\u2019s not one man\u2019s job to tell another man what he can do to his back,\u201d Matt told The Daily Show With Trevor Noah. \u201cI support him in all of his artistic expression.\u201d\n\nBut Lindsay is no artistic expression, and Matt \u201ccan\u2019t stand\u201d her. Only time will tell if these friends with so much history can make it work despite the bad blood.", "images": ["https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LS2319_cover_ns4_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Sofia-Richie-Scott-Disick-Miami-5.jpg?crop=0px%2C340px%2C2038px%2C2038px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Priyanka-Chopra-Nick-Jonas-Exclusive.jpg?crop=0px%2C54px%2C1984px%2C1124px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ben-affleck-groping.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ben-affleck-matt-damon-pic.png?w=1180&h=628&crop=1", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emma-Stone-Engaged-to-Boyfriend-Dave-McCary-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1408px%2C1408px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/teddi-mellencamp-tips-to-conceive-feature-e1575835265340.jpg?crop=0px%2C82px%2C1393px%2C789px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Britney-Spears-singing.jpg?crop=436px%2C0px%2C1601px%2C1601px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Alessandra-Ambrosio.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1699px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ben-affleck-daughter.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ben-affleck-lindsay-shookus-relationship.png?w=1180&h=757&crop=1", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jenna-Dewan-Steve-Kazee-Relationship-Timeline-Promo.jpg?crop=145px%2C0px%2C1736px%2C1736px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Hannah-Brown-and-Alan-Bersten.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C2310px%2C1309px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jeweler-Reveals-Story-Behind-Khloe-Kardashian-Infamous-True-Necklace-feat-01.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ben-affleck-jennifer-garner.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Ashley-Jared-Christmas.jpg?crop=0px%2C84px%2C3150px%2C1786px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gwen-Stefani-The-Voice-Promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C37px%2C1850px%2C1850px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ben-affleck-jennifer-garner-matt-damon-friends.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_editorial_10494437ak.jpg?crop=0px%2C82px%2C2769px%2C1571px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ben-affleck-jennifer-garner-matt-damon-friends.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_editorial_10493811em.jpg?crop=0px%2C146px%2C3150px%2C1784px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hannah-brown-ashley-iaconetti.jpg?crop=0px%2C25px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ben-affleck-jennifer-garner-matt-damon-friends.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alex Riccardi"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/matt-damon-ben-affleck-girlfriend-158910/", "title": "Matt Damon Doesn't Like Ben Affleck's Girlfriend Lindsay Shookus", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Are Matt Damon and Ben Affleck letting a woman come between them?
