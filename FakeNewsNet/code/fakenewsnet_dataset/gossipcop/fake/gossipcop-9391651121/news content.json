I really wanted to do one for ages,\u201d Pattinson told ET\u2019s Katie Krause at the Hollywood premiere of the film on Wednesday. \u201cI mean, I've played a lot of serious psychopaths so I thought I'd play a funny psychopath.\u201d\n\nThe film turns the Western archetype on its head thanks to Pattinson\u2019s co-star Mia Wasikowska\u2019s character, Penelope.\n\n\u201cIt seemed kind of subversive. Most Westerns, the archetype lead cowboy is someone who's sort of, they can handle anything and it\u2019s them against the world and they come to save the damsel but pretty much every single male character in this movie is completely inept,\u201d Pattinson explained. \u201cThey think they\u2019re trying to save the damsel but actually they\u2019re incapable of anything at all. They\u2019re incapable of saving themselves.\u201d\n\nGetty Images\n\nPattinson himself has worked with many strong boss ladies in his lengthy career, and named a few for ET. \u201cOh tons! I mean, I've worked with some real power houses. Definitely Mia is one of them, obviously. Kristin Scott Thomas, Uma Thurman,\u201d he said.\n\nBut what about his Twilight co-star and ex-girlfriend, Kristin Stewart?\n\n\u201cKristen Stewart, Kristen too! Kristen Stewart as well, yeah, yeah, yeah,\u201d he insisted. \u201cCatherine Hardwicke, too. She's great.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Pattinson and Stewart reunited at Lily-Rose Depp\u2019s 19th birthday party at the Chateau Marmont. This inevitably excited fans as it\u2019s been almost 10 years since the film version of Twilight was released.\n\nSo, what would Pattinson say to his younger self when looking back at his first day on set?\n\n\u201cI don't know, just have fun!\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole ride's been really great. I've just been incredibly lucky in my career and my life. I'm really appreciative of everything.\u201d\n\nMagnolia Pictures will release Damsel in theaters on June 22.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nKristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson Reunite at Lily-Rose Depp's Birthday Party: Pics\n\nRobert Pattinson Has His Gun, Guitar and Mini Horse in Official 'Damsel' Poster (Exclusive)\n\nRobert Pattinson Shirtless and Jogging Barefoot on the Beach Will Give You Edward Cullen Daydreams", "images": ["http://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640xh/public/images/2018-06/robert-pattinson-mia-gettyimages-974044604.jpg?itok=rC1QHW3S", "https://static.lakana.com/mmm-global-us-east-1/photo/2018/06/14/rob_patt_061318_11907830_ver1.0_160_90.jpg", "https://media.kxly.com/mmm-kxlytv-media-us-east-1/photo/logo-main.png", "https://static.lakana.com/mmm-global-us-east-1/photo/2018/06/14/rob_patt_061318_11907830_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "https://media.kxly.com/mmm-kxlytv-media-us-east-1/photo/2016/11/07/logo-lakana_4467136_ver1.0.png", "https://www.kxly.com/mmm-main-theme/images/color-schemes/kxly/placeholder/placeholder-16x9.jpg", "https://media.kxly.com/mmm-kxlytv-media-us-east-1/photo/2017/02/22/cnn-logo-86x41_5937116_ver1.0.png"], "top_img": "https://static.lakana.com/mmm-global-us-east-1/photo/2018/06/14/rob_patt_061318_11907830_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.kxly.com/entertainment/entertainment-tonight/robert-pattinson-praises-kristen-stewart-following-recent-reunion-exclusive-/753071782", "title": "Robert Pattinson praises Kristen Stewart following recent reunion (exclusive)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "It's&nbsp;Robert Pattinson like you\u2019ve never seen him before!", "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight,Entertainment", "og": {"title": "Robert Pattinson praises Kristen Stewart following recent reunion (exclusive)", "description": "It's\u00a0Robert Pattinson like you\u2019ve never seen him before!", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.kxly.com/entertainment/entertainment-tonight/robert-pattinson-praises-kristen-stewart-following-recent-reunion-exclusive-/753071782", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.lakana.com/mmm-global-us-east-1/photo/2018/06/14/rob_patt_061318_11907830_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "KXLY"}, "fb": {"app_id": 135437939819920}, "article": {"section": "Entertainment Tonight", "published_time": "2018-06-14T19:28:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-14T19:28:21+00:00", "expiration_time": "2043-02-03T08:57:00+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Robert Pattinson praises Kristen Stewart following recent reunion (exclusive)", "description": "It's\u00a0Robert Pattinson like you\u2019ve never seen him before!", "site": "KXLY", "image": "https://static.lakana.com/mmm-global-us-east-1/photo/2018/06/14/rob_patt_061318_11907830_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "domain": "https://www.kxly.com"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529004501.0, "source": "http://www.kxly.com", "summary": ""}
