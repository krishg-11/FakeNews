Now, the New Zealand pop star has tweeted a statement clarifying that that\u2019s not the case.\n\n\u201cTaylor is a dear friend,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI love her very much. \u2026 Really sh\u2013ty to wake up to headlines about whether or not you\u2019ve jumped ship on someone you deeply respect and ride for. I want to say one more time that Taylor has been there for me in all my dark and light moments these past five years. All of them.\u201d\n\nLorde did, however, take the opportunity to elaborate on the initial quote she gave in her interview, where she seemed to say that she doesn\u2019t hang out much with the famous friends she\u2019s made in recent years and isn\u2019t \u201ccalling [her] idols\u201d for advice.\n\nFor one, Lorde noted that while some had thought she was referencing Swift as an \u201cidol,\u201d she was really just referring to David Bowie and Patti Smith, who she\u2019d mentioned earlier in the interview.\n\nShe also expounded on the flaws of describing Swift\u2019s group of friends as a \u201csquad.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve always found people\u2019s perception of this \u2018squad\u2019 idea frustrating in the past,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt was never some exclusive club or secret society, but a wide circle of people, some of whom I know, and some who I\u2019ve never met, like most wide groups of friends. Forgive me for the mild eyeroll I popped when it was brought up as if we\u2019re all blood members of a secret cult.\u201d\n\nOf course, Lorde \u2014 whose second album, Melodrama, debuted at the top of Billboard\u2019s albums chart last month \u2014 brushed the whole thing off. \u201cI f\u2014ed up an interview question,\u201d she concluded. \u201cNow go sip a beverage and head out on a walk.\u201d See her complete note below.", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/gettyimages-461429760.jpg?crop=0px%2C171px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/gettyimages-461429760.jpg?crop=0px%2C171px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Eric Renner Brown"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/music/2017/07/07/taylor-swift-lorde-friendship-twitter-letter/", "title": "Lorde sets record straight on Taylor Swift friendship in fiery letter", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Lorde, Taylor Swift, squad", "news_keywords": "Lorde, Taylor Swift, squad", "description": "In an interview with an Australian news outlet on Friday, Lorde made comments some interpreted as suggesting she was on the outs with Taylor Swift.", "og": {"title": "Lorde Sets Record Straight on Taylor Swift Friendship in Fiery Letter", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/music/2017/07/07/taylor-swift-lorde-friendship-twitter-letter/", "description": "In an interview with an Australian news outlet on Friday, Lorde made comments some interpreted as suggesting she was on\u2026", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/gettyimages-461429760.jpg?crop=0px%2C171px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/music/2017/07/07/taylor-swift-lorde-friendship-twitter-letter/", "description": "In an interview with an Australian news outlet on Friday, Lorde made comments some interpreted as suggesting she was on the outs with Taylor Swift.", "media": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/gettyimages-461429760.jpg?crop=0px%2C171px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/music/2017/07/07/taylor-swift-lorde-friendship-twitter-letter/", "title": "Lorde Sets Record Straight on Taylor Swift Friendship in Fiery Letter", "description": "In an interview with an Australian news outlet on Friday, Lorde made comments some interpreted as suggesting she was on the outs with Taylor Swift.", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/gettyimages-461429760.jpg?crop=0px%2C171px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499400000.0, "source": "http://ew.com", "summary": ""}
