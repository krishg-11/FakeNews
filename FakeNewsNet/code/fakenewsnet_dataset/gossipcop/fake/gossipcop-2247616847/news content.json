When that happens, I think it won\u2019t take long until he takes the next big step and actually moves in with Kate.\u201d\n\nBetween Brad\u2019s six kids and her two, \u201cit\u2019s going to be like a funhouse,\u201d the source says.\n\nAlthough the couple didn\u2019t attend the Golden Globes together on January 8, they reportedly hooked up later.\n\n\u201cThere were whispers that they were going to meet up afterward at Brad\u2019s place in Los Feliz,\u201d the source says, adding that\u2019s a change of pace for the star who once shared the compound with Angelina and their brood.\n\n\u201cIn a way, having Kate come over shows just how much Brad is letting her into his life,\u201d says the source, adding, \u201cStill, they prefer to spend evenings at Kate\u2019s place.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/brand-logo-mobile-menu-colored.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/", "https://www.newidea.com.au/media/73139/ni4619_cover_nobc_bws.png?height=158", "https://secure-gl.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=au-pacmags&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/Images/idm-error-icon.svg", "https://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/brand-logo-nav.svg", "https://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/gmail.svg", "https://snowplow.swm.digital/i?e=se&se_ca=ping&tv=http-get-0.1.0&dtm=0&stm=0&tna=pac&p=web", "https://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/brand-logo-footer-new.svg", "https://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/brand-logo-gray.svg", "https://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/idm-thanks-icon.svg"], "top_img": "http://www.newidea.com.au/", "keywords": [], "authors": ["New Idea"], "canonical_link": "https://www.newidea.com.au/brad-pitt-moves-in-with-kate-hudson", "title": "Brad Pitt moves in with Kate Hudson", "meta_data": {"language": "en-us", "description": "That was fast...", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"site_name": "New Idea", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.newidea.com.au/brad-pitt-moves-in-with-kate-hudson", "title": "Brad Pitt moves in with Kate Hudson", "description": "That was fast...", "image": "http://www.newidea.com.au/"}, "twitter": {"title": "Brad Pitt moves in with Kate Hudson", "description": "That was fast...", "image": "http://www.newidea.com.au/", "url": "https://www.newidea.com.au/brad-pitt-moves-in-with-kate-hudson"}, "fb": {"admins": 863618607005758, "pages": 140279489324860}, "msvalidate.01": "3BD3CB44DC500E9821E82E085D0F0D13", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1484775337.22, "source": "https://www.newidea.com.au", "summary": ""}
