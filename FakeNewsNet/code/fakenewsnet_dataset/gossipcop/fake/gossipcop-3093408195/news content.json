So foolish! Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nSad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\n...can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\n...the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\nThe president's tweets revived his claim on Tuesday that by removing Confederate statues, local governments and activists are \"changing history, you\u2019re changing culture.\"\n\nEfforts to remove memorials to the losing side in the Civil War have stepped up since hundreds of white supremacists descended on Charlottesville. The city of Baltimore overnight Tuesday took down four memorials. Another statue in Durham, N.C., was pulled down by protestors.\n\nIn a defiant news conference on Tuesday, Trump defended those who gathered in Charlottesville last weekend to protest the city's decision to take down a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nHe suggested that allowing the statue's removal could lead to the removal of other monuments to the country's Founding Fathers, like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.\n\nTrump also appeared to equate counterprotesters with the white supremacists and neo-Nazi groups who incited violence in the college town Saturday.\n\nThe remarks disappointed many Republicans, who believed Trump was moving beyond the controversy on Monday with a statement blaming white supremacists and neo-Nazis specifically for their roles in Charlottesville's violence.\n\nTrump, who has a history of doubling down on his position when he comes under criticism, earlier on Thursday lashed out at Sens.
