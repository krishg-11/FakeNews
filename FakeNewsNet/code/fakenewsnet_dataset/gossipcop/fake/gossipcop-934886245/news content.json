The exterior of the home is a muted tone and surrounded by lush gardens and trees creating a very jungle-like feel.\n\nThe interior is modern but comfy, with all the amenities you would expect a celeb home to have, but the master bedroom is the star. It\u2019s 2,300 square feet!\n\nThe home was listed for $16.9M in April 2017, and after multiple price reductions, Kylie and Scott got a \u201cdeal\u201d \u2013 they paid $13.45M.\n\nWe\u2019ve got more where that came from!

They rented the home for an undisclosed amount from Kylie, and we\u2019re unsure if he still lives here. We do know that Kylie HAS NOT sold the home even though she has her own place nearby.

The brand new build has 6-bedroom and 8-bathrooms.\n\nShe dropped $9.925 million on the new pad. Some outlets are reporting that this is an investment property due to it\u2019s close proximity to her current home. However, we find it hard to believe.

Features to Jenner\u2019s newest abode include a large swimming pool & spa, a game room, an outdoor barbecue area, and a home theater.\n\nShe has also said many times that \u201cKim lives across the street\u201d in interviews, and her main home above is not across the street, this one is.
