The ex-couple recent went through divorce with their respective spouses. Post that, the fans started joking about Jen-Brad reconciliation. However, this joke turned to reality real soon and the reports are rife that the two are dating. The latest piece of news around their relationship is that they might have a baby soon!\n\nA source told In Touch Weekly, \"His marriage [to Angelina Jolie] fell apart, then her marriage to Justin [Theroux] ended. During that difficult time, Brad and Jen reconnected. It's like destiny brought them together, and I can definitely see them having a child together.\u201d\n\nThe source also added that the couple might try the IVF method. While Brad Pitt has six children with Angeline Jolie, this will be Jennifer\u2019s first child. The source added, \u201c\"Even if it meant months of trying IVF. When Jen sets her mind to something, she doesn't stop until she succeeds.\u201d The source further went on to say that this is the \u2018ultimate slap\u2019 on Angelina\u2019s face and that she is livid about their decision. \"They both have changed over the years and, after much heartache, are at a great place in their lives. Brad loves the idea of how they'd both come full circle and found each other again. Having a child together seems like the perfect next step, the source revealed.\n\nWell, we won\u2019t mind believing this amazing piece of news for a while. After all, all the \u2018Friends\u2019 fanclubs dreamed about this day since ages!", "images": ["https://st1.latestly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Liquide-Liquide-185x104.png",
