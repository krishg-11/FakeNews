The event \u2014 which was thrown for 150 lucky fans to benefit J.C. Reaching Out, a local charity that provides assistance to family members of people battling cancer \u2014 was a prelude to Saturday\u2019s block party, which will officially open the venue.\n\nIn between songs like \u201cNeon Light,\u201d \u201cA Guy with a Girl,\u201d \u201cThe Baby,\u201d \u201cEvery Time I Hear That Song,\u201d and fittingly, \u201cOl\u2019 Red,\u201d Shelton joked about the origins of their relationship \u2014 explaining they \u201cstarted hanging out together and messing around.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Kevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nHis admission had Stefani, whose oldest sons Zuma, 8, and Kingston, 10, were in the audience, shook. In video captured of the moment and shared online by her fans, Stefani can be seen lifting her head from Shelton\u2019s shoulder and flashing him a shocked expression.\n\nBut Shelton, with the cheers of the audience behind him, quickly recovered from the apparent snafu. \u201cYou know, texting each other,\u201d he said.\n\nGood morning.

From red carpet appearances and on-stage performances to their undying support of one another from a distance and their sweet selfies, the pair are a match made in heaven \u2014 blending their families together, sharing holidays, and even collaborating on songs including \u201cGo Ahead and Break My Heart\u201d (off of Shelton\u2019s album, If I\u2019m Honest), and \u201cYou Make It Feel Like Christmas\u201d (the title track of Stefani\u2019s upcoming Christmas album).\n\nImage zoom Erika Goldring/Getty Images\n\nRELATED VIDEO: How Gwen Stefani Surprised Herself as a Mom of Three Boys\n\nAnd Stefani has turned into Shelton\u2019s biggest fan too. On Friday, she live-streamed clips of his concert on her Instagram account \u2014 singing along to his songs and smiling wide throughout.\n\n\u201cI love Blake!\u201d Stefani gushed about Shelton on Late Night With Seth Meyers earlier this year. \u201cHe is the most incredible guy. Everybody loves Blake, and that\u2019s the thing. There\u2019s no way around it. He\u2019s just a sparkly like happy, amazing person.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59d6486f5205aabdbf65fd1a39fa97ee?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/blake-shelton1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Quinn"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/country/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-messing-around/", "title": "Gwen Stefani Joins Blake Shelton Onstage as He Jokes About 'Messin' Around' When They First Met", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani, Blake Shelton Gwen Stefani, Blake Shelton Gwen Stefani dating, Blake Shelton Gwen Stefani romance, Blake Shelton Gwen Stefani duets, Blake Shelton concert, Blake Shelton Ole Red Tishomingo, Gwen Stefani Instagram", "news_keywords": "Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani, Blake Shelton Gwen Stefani, Blake Shelton Gwen Stefani dating, Blake Shelton Gwen Stefani romance, Blake Shelton Gwen Stefani duets, Blake Shelton concert, Blake Shelton Ole Red Tishomingo, Gwen Stefani Instagram", "description": "Blake Shelton\u00a0and\u00a0Gwen Stefani\u00a0have going strong since they\u00a0began dating in November 2015, and apparently their romance has been hot and heavy since the beginning", "og": {"title": "Gwen Stefani Joins Blake Shelton Onstage As He Jokes About 'Messin' Around' When They First Met", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/country/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-messing-around/", "description": "Blake Shelton\u00a0and\u00a0Gwen Stefani\u00a0have going strong since they\u00a0began dating in November 2015, and apparently their romance has been hot and heavy since the beginning", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/country/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-messing-around/", "description": "Blake Shelton\u00a0and\u00a0Gwen Stefani\u00a0have going strong since they\u00a0began dating in November 2015, and apparently their romance has been hot and heavy since the beginning", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/country/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-messing-around/", "title": "Gwen Stefani Joins Blake Shelton Onstage As He Jokes About 'Messin' Around' When They First Met", "description": "Blake Shelton\u00a0and\u00a0Gwen Stefani\u00a0have going strong since they\u00a0began dating in November 2015, and apparently their romance has been hot and heavy since the beginning", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://people.com", "summary": ""}
