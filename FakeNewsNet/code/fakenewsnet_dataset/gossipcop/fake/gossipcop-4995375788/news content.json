West kept things classic in a dapper black suit, while Kardashian dressed in a sultry black dress that certainly wasn't short on the cleavage or curve-hugging sex appeal. Well, at least she didn't wear white, right?\n\nKris Jenner may have officiated the nuptials of Colton Haynes and Jeff Leatham, but the officiant wasn't the only celeb in the room.
