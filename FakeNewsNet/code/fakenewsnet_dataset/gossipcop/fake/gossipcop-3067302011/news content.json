In October 2015, Vance Jr. declined to press charges after an investigation into whether Weinstein groped Italian model Ambra Battilana.\n\nSome said Friday that it was remarkable to see Weinstein face charges. Asia Argento, who said Weinstein sexually assaulted her, said on Friday: \u201cWe, the women, finally have real hope for justice.\u201d\n\nThe New York charges are the first against Weinstein, even though several other cities opened up investigations into the producer in the wake of the reporting on the allegations.\n\nGet The Brief.
