The actress attended the second annual London Modest Fashion Week over the weekend, and she dressed the part.\n\nBefore the show, she posted a video on her Instagram, in which she learned how to style a hijab and expressed her desire to wear it traditionally. \u201cI think it needs [to be] a little bit more tighter in the [back]. I don\u2019t want it to come off and show too much,\u201d the once risqu\u00e9 woman told her hijab-tutor in the video.\n\nPhoto: BBC News More\n\nWhen someone suggested she switch wrapping styles so she could wear it as tight as she wanted, she said she wanted \u201cto do traditional Saudi wrap. \u2026 That\u2019s what I\u2019d rather learn to do so I know. \u2026 I want to learn how to do it properly.\u201d This could be because she\u2019s set to film an all-female movie in Saudi Arabia. She then told the woman that she had been living in Dubai for three years.\n\nShe also posted a video from the fashion show and spoke to BBC Minute about modest apparel. \u201cFashion doesn\u2019t always have to be so naked and can be adventurous and still beautiful, with a strong group of women behind it,\u201d Lohan said.\n\nNot only did she wear the right clothing, she also wore the right makeup. According to halal/vegetarian/vegan makeup retailer HawaCosmetics, Lohan stopped by their booth and told them about \u201chow she\u2019s into halal cosmetics and what she\u2019s actually wearing on her face today was all halal!!\u201d according to their social media post. They were referencing the Muslim diet and referring to avoiding non-halal makeup.\n\n\n\n\n\nLohan\u2019s efforts to respect Muslim traditions are getting mixed reactions. Some people really into this look were impressed by her interest, including the designers.\n\n@lindsaylohan is getting fitted for a hijab on her insta live right now and I am LIVING #Traditional \u2014 Evan \u2615\ufe0fBlackWhite (@EvBenjamin) February 17, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nCan we deep, a whole fabulous @lindsaylohan repping at London Modest Fashion week @HauteElan!

Now there\u2019s a role model. \u2014 Adele (@Contented2851) February 19, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nOthers were angry that Lohan was promoting what they see as oppressive attire, especially when women are protesting wearing the hijab in Iran right now and getting arrested for it. \u201cIt amazes me how the western civilization sees wearing the hijab as an act of liberation and empowerment while women in Iran are removing their hijabs off as a protest, meaning the hijab is actually a sign of oppression in muslim countries,\u201d one follower tweeted. One user accused Lohan of \u201cnormalizing Islamic misogyny.\u201d\n\nSince when did promoting oppressive articles of clothing become a thing? Especially when women take off their hijab's in protest\u2026seems counter-productive\u2026 \u2014 Lindsey D (@lindseyaya87) February 18, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nIt amazes me how the western civilisation sees wearing the hijab as an act of liberation and empowerment while women in Iran are taking the hijab off as a protest, meaning the hijab is actually a sign of oppression in muslim countries.@DouglasKMurray \u2014 Tom Livne (@countertommy) February 19, 2018", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/gNqlt6qkV6S5HnIKk4s_yQ--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODQ7aD04NDtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/plogos/ylifelogo_jelly.jpg", "https://s.yimg.com/nn/lib/metro/DailyFantasy_BN_Baseball_300x250-min.jpg", "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mZrYtn7olE.DESwWdKiddQ--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MTUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/0aa169ed2fda44bb5ebd0c655f834dbc", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VqNGrSxGhpJgfe0V197qSg--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9MTUwMDtoPTEwMDA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/0aa169ed2fda44bb5ebd0c655f834dbc"], "top_img": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mZrYtn7olE.DESwWdKiddQ--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MTUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/0aa169ed2fda44bb5ebd0c655f834dbc", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maggie Parker"], "canonical_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/lindsay-lohan-wears-hijab-social-media-mixed-feelings-214247444.html", "title": "Lindsay Lohan wears a hijab, sparking mixed feelings on social media", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_frontpage_en-US_s_f_w_bestfit_frontpage.png", "msvalidate.01": "A9862C0E6E1BE95BCE0BF3D0298FD58B", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#400090", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@YahooLifestyle", "player": {"identifier": "https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle-news/lindsay-lohan-wears-hijab-sparking-173401893.html?format=embed&region=US&lang=en-US&site=lifestyle&player_autoplay=true", "height": 281, "width": 500}, "card": "player", "description": "The actress attended the second annual London Modest Fashion Week over the weekend, and she dressed the part.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mZrYtn7olE.DESwWdKiddQ--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MTUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/0aa169ed2fda44bb5ebd0c655f834dbc", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mZrYtn7olE.DESwWdKiddQ--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MTUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/0aa169ed2fda44bb5ebd0c655f834dbc"}, "title": "Lindsay Lohan wears a hijab, sparking mixed feelings on social media"}, "application-name": "Yahoo Lifestyle", "news_keywords": "Lindsay Lohan, modest fashion, fashion show, hijab", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=304158842,app-argument=yahoo://article/view?uuid=488be383-c829-3dd5-aa41-2c05b7f6d290&src=web", "description": "The actress attended the second annual London Modest Fashion Week over the weekend, and she dressed the part.", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mZrYtn7olE.DESwWdKiddQ--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MTUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/0aa169ed2fda44bb5ebd0c655f834dbc", "description": "The actress attended the second annual London Modest Fashion Week over the weekend, and she dressed the part.", "title": "Lindsay Lohan wears a hijab, sparking mixed feelings on social media", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/lindsay-lohan-wears-hijab-social-media-mixed-feelings-214247444.html"}, "fb": {"app_id": 458584288257241, "pages": 828031943896361}, "al": {"android": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo", "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=488be383-c829-3dd5-aa41-2c05b7f6d290&src=web"}, "ios": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "app_store_id": 304158842, "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=488be383-c829-3dd5-aa41-2c05b7f6d290&src=web"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519076567.0, "source": "http://www.yahoo.com", "summary": ""}
