Gomez shared a shot from her new campaign on Instagram writing, \u201cStriking a pose in the new @puma Defy Mid. #DoYou.\u201d\n\nGomez unveiled her new shoot days after news broke that her longtime on-and-off boyfriend Justin Bieber proposed to model Hailey Baldwin.\n\nImage zoom Puma\n\nLooking for more style content?

The statement tee, available for $49 at online clothing retailer Storets, featured the slogan \u201cOnly the Strong Survive\u201d written in white letters across the pocket, possibly a cryptic message about her feelings since her ex\u2019s announcement.\n\nRELATED PHOTOS: Selena Gomez, Kim Kardashian and More Stars Who Have Experienced Spray Tan Fails\n\nImage zoom PapCulture/SplashNews.com\n\nAfter splitting from The Weeknd, n\u00e9 Abel Tesfaye, last October, Gomez and Bieber began spending time together again. The exes were spotted riding bikes, kissing at his hockey games and even attended his dad Jeremy\u2019s wedding in Jamaica together. However, after marking Bieber\u2019s 24th birthday on her Instagram account, the couple\u2019s newly rekindled romance ended abruptly.\n\n\u201cIt was never a healthy situation for Selena and Justin,\u201d said the source. Added a Bieber pal: \u201cTheir relationship was always very complex and complicated. It was just too much baggage.\u201d\n\nBieber officially confirmed his engagement to Baldwin on Monday just hours after his ex was photographed out in N.Y.C.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/18aw_rt_amp-xt_q3_selena_1754_rgb.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C7360px%2C3864px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/18aw_rt_amp-xt_q3_selena_1754_rgb.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/selena-gomez-1-20001.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/da5e7d01afedc1c31666e045b98aacc4?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/18aw_rt_amp-xt_q3_selena_1754_rgb.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C7360px%2C3864px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kaitlyn Frey"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/style/selena-gomez-puma-ad-sports-bra-justin-bieber-engagement/", "title": "Selena Gomez Promotes New Puma Campaign After Ex Justin Bieber's Engagement News", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Celebrity Ad Campaigns,Justin Bieber,Music News,News,Selena Gomez,Style,Style News", "news_keywords": "Celebrity Ad Campaigns,Justin Bieber,Music News,News,Selena Gomez,Style,Style News", "description": "See the star's latest campaign for the activewear label", "og": {"title": "Selena Gomez Is Business as Usual Amid Ex Justin Bieber's Engagement: See Her Fierce New Puma Ads", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/style/selena-gomez-puma-ad-sports-bra-justin-bieber-engagement/", "description": "See the star's latest campaign for the activewear label", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/18aw_rt_amp-xt_q3_selena_1754_rgb.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C7360px%2C3864px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/style/selena-gomez-puma-ad-sports-bra-justin-bieber-engagement/", "description": "See the star's latest campaign for the activewear label", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/18aw_rt_amp-xt_q3_selena_1754_rgb.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C7360px%2C3864px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/style/selena-gomez-puma-ad-sports-bra-justin-bieber-engagement/", "title": "Selena Gomez Is Business as Usual Amid Ex Justin Bieber's Engagement: See Her Fierce New Puma Ads", "description": "See the star's latest campaign for the activewear label", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/18aw_rt_amp-xt_q3_selena_1754_rgb.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C7360px%2C3864px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://people.com", "summary": ""}
