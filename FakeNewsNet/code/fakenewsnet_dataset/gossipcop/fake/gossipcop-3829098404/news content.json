Camilla Parker Bowles has allegedly warned the Suits star to stay away from Prince Harry but will she follow through?\n\nAccording to Inquistr, Bowles was in Toronto last weekend and told Markle that she shouldn\u2019t exchange vows with Harry. The actor has been dating the British prince since November 2016 and gotten along great with other members of the royal family. That might have changed after Markle agreed to meet Bowles on the occasion of Canada\u2019s 150th anniversary.\n\nPrince Harry has iftari with Muslim community in Singapore\n\n\u201cCamilla told Meghan that she didn\u2019t like her relationship with Harry and that she should think twice before agreeing to his marriage proposal. Otherwise, Camilla was planning to make her life very tough,\u201d a source revealed. \u201cShe\u2019s long thought Meghan isn\u2019t good enough for Harry and told her that she\u2019s not welcome in the royal family.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first sign of hostility from the Royals either. In January, rumours surfaced that Bowles was trying hard to ensure the youngsters\u2019 romance didn\u2019t last. Bowles doesn\u2019t like Markle because she has been married in the past and brings a celebrity status to the royal family. Bowles was also thought to be the reason Prince William broke up with Kate Middleton in 2007.\n\nMeanwhile, Daily Mail has released excerpts from Markle\u2019s personal diary that show that the relationship is quite stressful. Between her acting career and Harry\u2019s royal status in England, the two hardly have any time away from the media. That said, Markle\u2019s diary closes with her thinking about a possible wedding, and it looks like 2018 might be the year. Of course, that will change if Bowles gets her way.\n\nHarry confirmed his romance with Markle in November by issuing an official statement that slammed the media for hounding the latter. Although Harry is clearly protective of her privacy, the Markle family might be getting their own reality TV series called Meet the Markles in the near future.\n\nCamilla Parker Bowles clawed and fought her way to acceptance into the British royal family and can\u2019t understand how easy it is for one woman to be so warmly welcomed. Granted, this woman isn\u2019t having an affair with a married future king or is central to placing the monarchy in a scandal. Instead, she\u2019s an American who has caught the eye of a younger royal. Times have changed and tolerance for the unconventional exists more now than it did when Camilla was having an affair with Charles while he was married to the late Princess Diana.\n\nThe past lingers in the Duchess\u2019 mind\n\nA palace insider claims that Camilla Parker Bowles is resentful at how easy it is for #Meghan Markle to make her way into the firm.\n\nShe\u2019s being warmly welcomed by the Windsors. The source sums it up by saying that Parker Bowles can\u2019t believe \u201cwhat an easy entree\u201d Meghan is getting. It\u2019s far easier for her to gain acceptance by everyone than it was for her. This is especially true of the queen, \u201cwho made her life hell\u201d when she was dating Charles. Everything is fine now, but it was a rough ride for quite a while.\n\nThe source adds that \u201cit\u2019s as if a circle of Rottweilers\u201d are sur Meghan because no one can say a bad word about her. Prince Harry is in love with Markle and wants support from his family. He\u2019s getting it, according to the report.\n\nThe source continues that Camilla Parker Bowles intends to \u201cobstruct\u201d Meghan Markle\u2019s path in any way that she can. It\u2019s unfair in her eyes that this woman who isn\u2019t even British is having it so easy.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171213101043im_/http://allthingsoneplace.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/title-116-364x205.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171213101043im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8117a7d82d92fe7cdb6901cefd0a752c?s=40&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171213101043im_/http://allthingsoneplace.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/5-71.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171213101043im_/http://allthingsoneplace.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1-65.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171213101043im_/http://allthingsoneplace.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/title-118-364x205.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171213101043im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f371a07d317609608cfef71e07b81462?s=40&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171213101043im_/http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1ad6917892cc1ebbc23e048b834a84a3?s=40&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171213101043im_/http://allthingsoneplace.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/6-70.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171213101043im_/http://allthingsoneplace.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screenshot_1-5-364x205.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171213101043im_/http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1ad6917892cc1ebbc23e048b834a84a3?s=30&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171213101043im_/http://allthingsoneplace.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/title-119-364x205.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171213101043im_/http://allthingsoneplace.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/title-63.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171213101043im_/http://allthingsoneplace.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/7-70.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171213101043im_/http://allthingsoneplace.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/title-117-364x205.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171213101043im_/http://allthingsoneplace.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/title-120-364x205.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171213101043im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2ee69e5139d8c5fbbfd86f0451237032?s=40&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171213101043im_/http://allthingsoneplace.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/13-67.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171213101043im_/http://allthingsoneplace.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/4-70.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171213101043im_/http://allthingsoneplace.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/title-63.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brian Johnson", "Julie Williams", "Mary Isabella Kidd"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171213101043/http://allthingsoneplace.me/camilla-warned-meghan-markle-about-marrying-to-prince-harry/", "title": "Camilla Warned Meghan Markle About Marrying To Prince Harry", "meta_data": {"og": {"type": "article", "title": "Camilla Warned Meghan Markle About Marrying To Prince Harry", "description": "Looks like there may be some trouble in paradise for Meghan Markle.
