{"url": "www.glamour.com/story/chrissy-teigen-postpartum-depression", "text": "I went back to work on Lip Sync Battle in August, when Luna was four months. The show treated me incredibly well\u2014they put a nursery in my dressing room and blew up photos of Luna and John and my family for my wall. When Luna was on set, they lowered the noise levels. They turned down the air so she wouldn\u2019t be cold. Only the most gentle knocking on the door. Pump breaks. I mean, there was no better place to get to go back to work to.\n\nBut I was different than before. Getting out of bed to get to set on time was painful. My lower back throbbed; my \u00adshoulders\u2014even my wrists\u2014hurt. I didn\u2019t have an appetite. I would go two days without a bite of food, and you know how big of a deal food is for me. One thing that really got me was just how short I was with people.\n\nI would be in my dressing room, sitting in a robe, getting hair and makeup done, and a crew member would knock on the door and ask: \u201cChrissy, do you know the lyrics to this song?\u201d And I would lose it. Or \u201cChrissy, do you like these cat ears, or these panda hands?\u201d And I\u2019d be like: \u201cWhatever you want. I don\u2019t care.\u201d They would leave. My eyes would well up and I would burst into tears. My makeup artist would pat them dry and give me a few minutes.\n\nI couldn\u2019t figure out why I was so unhappy. I blamed it on being tired and possibly growing out of the role: \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just not a goofy person anymore. Maybe I\u2019m just supposed to be a mom.\u201d\n\nWhen I wasn\u2019t in the studio, I never left the house. I mean, never. Not even a tiptoe outside. I\u2019d ask people who came inside why they were wet. Was it raining? How would I know\u2014I had every shade closed. Most days were spent on the exact same spot on the couch and rarely would I muster up the energy to make it upstairs for bed. John would sleep on the couch with me, sometimes four nights in a row. I started keeping robes and comfy clothes in the pantry so I wouldn\u2019t have to go upstairs when John went to work. There was a lot of spontaneous crying.", "images": ["http://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b73f7444ad5e14c23a03a9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/chrissy-teigen-april17-01.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b73f740aac72189c03c1fd/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/chrissy-teigen-april17-02.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b8a77e72d5a047cb7f24f2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202017-03-02%2520at%25205.46.35%2520PM.png", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b73f766b5e90715a100cce/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/chrissy-teigen-april17-lede.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b73f755dc429701015cb98/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/chrissy-teigen-april17-04.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b73f7540800d79a851f027/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/chrissy-teigen-april17-pullquote.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b73f7450629d72400bb1f5/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/chrissy-teigen-april17-03.jpg", "http://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b8a77e72d5a047cb7f24f2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202017-03-02%2520at%25205.46.35%2520PM.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Chrissy Teige"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/chrissy-teigen-postpartum-depression", "title": "Chrissy Teigen Opens Up for the First Time About Her Postpartum Depression", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "In her interview for the cover of Glamour's April 2017 issue, Chrissy Teigen opens up about her postpartum depression.", "id": "58b741e550629d72400bb20b", "keywords": "chrissy teigen,cover stars,postpartum,Motherhood", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "58b741e550629d72400bb20b", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"In her interview for the cover of Glamour's April 2017 issue, Chrissy Teigen opens up about her postpartum depression.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b73f7450629d72400bb1f5/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/chrissy-teigen-april17-03.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b73f7450629d72400bb1f5/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/chrissy-teigen-april17-03.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "\"The mental pain of knowing I let so many people down at once was worse than the physical pain.\"", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b8a77e72d5a047cb7f24f2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202017-03-02%2520at%25205.46.35%2520PM.png", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Chrissy Teigen Opens Up About Her Postpartum Depression", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/chrissy-teigen-postpartum-depression"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\"The mental pain of knowing I let so many people down at once was worse than the physical pain.\"", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b8a77e72d5a047cb7f24f2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202017-03-02%2520at%25205.46.35%2520PM.png?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Chrissy Teigen Opens Up About Her Postpartum Depression"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
