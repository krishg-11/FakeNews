She also reportedly alleges that the Kardashians \u201cfalsely\u201d accusing her of physically abusing Rob contributed to the show\u2019s demise.\n\nImage zoom Blac Chyna, Kim Kardashian West Phillip Faraone/WireImage; Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

(E! declined to comment at the time.)\n\nIn December, attorneys for Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian West and Rob filed a \u201cdemurrer\u201d challenging the basis of Chyna\u2019s lawsuit against them and asking a judge to dismiss her case. In the filings, attorneys alleged Chyna herself prevented the show from filming after obtaining a domestic violence restraining order against Rob in July.\n\nImage zoom Blac Chyna and Rob Kardashian. Prince Williams/WireImage\n\nThe order prevented Rob from contacting Chyna \u201ceither directly or indirectly, in any way\u201d and required him to stay away from her, her home and place of work. The April 30 filing by Chyna asserted that any evidentiary determination is premature and that she has pleaded sufficient facts to move the case forward.\n\nThat filing is part of a larger suit that Chyna filed against Rob and the family in October in which she argued that she suffered \u201csignificant damages\u201d after her ex\u2019s social media rampage July 5, when he shared graphic and expletive-ridden content about her \u2014 including three naked photos \u2014 while accusing her of drug/alcohol abuse and infidelity. Chyna alleged that the nude photo scandal \u2014 along with influence from the Kardashian family \u2014 are what got Rob & Chyna axed.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Blac Chyna Says She\u2019ll Protect Kids \u2018At All Costs\u2019 After Fight Video Shows Her Swinging Stroller\n\nChyna claimed that Life of Kylie replaced the second season of Rob & Chyna, which was initially renewed but later halted. She specifically alleged that it was only after Rob, Kylie and his family \u201cintentionally interfered so as to kill season two of Rob & Chyna that Life of Kylie was created.\u201d\n\nAs such, Chyna alleged that the money Kylie, 19, earned for Life of Kylie was acquired through \u201cunlawful means\u201d that interfered with Chyna\u2019s contract for a second season of Rob & Chyna.\n\nChyna\u2019s legal team has argued that the family had already interfered with plans for a season 2 of Rob & Chyna before the restraining order was issued and that filming for the season could have been completed beforehand.\n\nRob has denied the physical and verbal assault claims brought against him by his ex. The former couple shares a daughter, Dream Kardashian.\n\nLife of Kylie ran for eight episodes starting in August 2017; Rob & Chyna season 1 consisted of seven episodes and aired from September-December 2016, when E! announced the renewal.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/blac-chyna2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/blac-chyna2.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/blac-chyna1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5c1648abf15ab582b95dc580d09b34c5?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/blac-chyna2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mike Miller"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/blac-chyna-kardashians-threatened-leave-e-rob-chyna-report/", "title": "Blac Chyna Says Kardashians Conspired to Cancel Her Show", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Blac Chyna,Kardashians,Keeping Up with the Kardashians,News,Rob &amp; Chyna,TV", "news_keywords": "Blac Chyna,Kardashians,Keeping Up with the Kardashians,News,Rob &amp; Chyna,TV", "description": "She is asking for a trail of paperwork she believes will prove her accusations, TMZ reports.", "og": {"title": "Blac Chyna Says Kardashians Threatened to Leave E!
