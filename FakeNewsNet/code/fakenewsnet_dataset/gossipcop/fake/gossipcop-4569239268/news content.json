But when he gets manic, it\u2019s really hard for everyone around him,\u201d the insider says. \u201cKim is absolutely worried about him right now, but she will defend him publicly to the end. She\u2019s a very loyal wife, and her tweets and everything she\u2019s been saying is definitely very calculated to help Kanye.\u201d\n\nKardashian West defended her husband in a series of tweets of her own, arguing that reports labeling him \u201cas having mental health issues for just being himself when he has always been expressive\u201d are \u201cnot fair.\u201d\n\nThe mom of three \u2014 Chicago, 3 months, Saint, 2, and North, 4\u00bd \u2014 also appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show this week, where she brushed off her husband\u2019s surprise return to social media.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know he got his Twitter again until I started seeing tweets coming in from other people retweeting them. And I was like, \u2018Wait, is this real?\u2019 And then at night he came in and said, \u2018Did you see my tweets?\u2019 I was like, \u2018Yes, I did see your tweets,\u2019 and I followed him back,\u201d she explained on the talk show.\n\nImage zoom Kanye West and Kim Kardahian West Pascal Le Segretain/Getty\n\nA source previously told PEOPLE that despite West\u2019s tweet storm, \u201cFor the rest of the family, things are going on normally.\u201d A second source also confirmed to PEOPLE that nobody \u2014 including his wife \u2014 has altered their \u201cwork\u201d schedules.\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

According to several sources, West has cut off contact with many members of his inner circle, including his managers, lawyers and closest friends \u2014 and he\u2019s also had multiple arguments with his mother-in-law Kris Jenner.\n\nHowever, another insider said that \u201cKanye and Kris have never had a fight,\u201d adding, \u201cJust because Kanye is having a strong opinion does not mean that he is mentally ill or headed for a breakdown. It\u2019s unfair.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Kanye West Rindoff/Dufour/Getty\n\nWest revealed to TMZ on Tuesday that he suffered from an opioid addiction after becoming dependent on the pain medications following a liposuction procedure in 2016.\n\nThe star also told the website that shortly after his cosmetic surgery he suffered a mental breakdown and was taking medication in the wake of his subsequent hospitalization.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m in a stronger place than I ever was after the breakdown, or I like to say, the breakthrough,\u201d the musician, told iHeartRadio\u2019s The Breakfast Club\u2019s Charlamagne tha God in an interview that was also released on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy it happened. I\u2019m happy to have gone to the other side and back,\u201d West told Charlamagne about being hospitalized. \u201cI can\u2019t express to you how traumatizing that moment is [when your friends and family leave the hospital] and then you wake up drugged the f\u2014 out.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he\u2019s currently on medications, the rapper said, \u201cMost definitely.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an imperfect solution because it calmed me down. But there\u2019s a lot of ways to calm down. Let \u2018Ye be \u2018Ye,\u201d continued West, who added that has yet to seek help from a therapist.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/kanye-west-3.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/kanye-west-kim-kardashian.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1410px%2C740.25px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/editorial-franchise-exclusive.png", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/116ab788de5f8b786cd3e7aa9ed6e0c3?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/kanye-west-kim-kardashian.jpg"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/kanye-west-kim-kardashian.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1410px%2C740.25px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Petit", "Melody Chiu"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/music/kim-kardashian-absolutely-worried-kanye-west-defend-him-publicly/", "title": "Kim Kardashian West Will Publicly Defend Kanye West 'to the End': Source", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Exclusive,Kanye West,Kim Kardashian,Music News,News,TV", "news_keywords": "Exclusive,Kanye West,Kim Kardashian,Music News,News,TV", "description": "\"[Kim Kardashian]'s a very loyal wife, and her tweets and everything she's been saying is definitely very calculated to help Kanye,\" a source says", "og": {"title": "Kim Kardashian West Is 'Absolutely Worried' About Kanye West But Will 'Defend Him Publicly to the End': Source", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/music/kim-kardashian-absolutely-worried-kanye-west-defend-him-publicly/", "description": "\"[Kim Kardashian]'s a very loyal wife, and her tweets and everything she's been saying is definitely very calculated to help Kanye,\" a source says", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/kanye-west-kim-kardashian.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1410px%2C740.25px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/music/kim-kardashian-absolutely-worried-kanye-west-defend-him-publicly/", "description": "\"[Kim Kardashian]'s a very loyal wife, and her tweets and everything she's been saying is definitely very calculated to help Kanye,\" a source says", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/kanye-west-kim-kardashian.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1410px%2C740.25px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/music/kim-kardashian-absolutely-worried-kanye-west-defend-him-publicly/", "title": "Kim Kardashian West Is 'Absolutely Worried' About Kanye West But Will 'Defend Him Publicly to the End': Source", "description": "\"[Kim Kardashian]'s a very loyal wife, and her tweets and everything she's been saying is definitely very calculated to help Kanye,\" a source says", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/kanye-west-kim-kardashian.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1410px%2C740.25px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://people.com", "summary": ""}
