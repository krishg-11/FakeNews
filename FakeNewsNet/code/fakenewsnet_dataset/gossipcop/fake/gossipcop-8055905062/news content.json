A new report claims the estranged spouses have reconciled and are \u201crebuilding\u201d their family. Gossip Cop, however, can debunk the inaccurate story.\n\n\n\nA headline in the latest edition of Globe exclaims, \u201cBrad & Angie Hot Again!\u201d According to this \u201cworld exclusive,\u201d Pitt and Jolie have \u201cmended fences in a sizzling reunion between the sheets.\u201d The supermarket tabloid alleges the real reason their divorce hasn\u2019t been finalized is because the stars \u201ccouldn\u2019t bring themselves to sign the papers.\u201d Instead, contends the magazine, \u201cthe warring exes had a steamy, clothes-ripping reconciliation.\u201d\n\n\n\nNotably, it\u2019s not said just when this alleged reunion occurred. But a so-called \u201cinsider\u201d is quoted as saying, \u201cIt was exciting and explosive, and it settled old scores and made them realize they weren\u2019t done with each other.\u201d What, was this supposed source in the room with them? Perhaps hiding under the bed? Or in the closet? In any case, the purported tipster goes on to assert, \u201cThey care for each other and they want to work things out.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s even alleged Pitt dropped a \u201cbombshell admission\u201d to an unnamed pal, in which he declared, \u201cI love my wife!\u201d The outlet and its \u201cinsider\u201d further claim Jolie has given him a key to her home so he can \u201ccome and go as he pleases,\u201d and that they\u2019ve had \u201cseveral hookups in the last few weeks.\u201d Maintains the questionable snitch, \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say the divorce is off!\u201d\n\n\n\nThe story is filled out with claims about a future \u201csecond commitment ceremony.\u201d It\u2019s also said Pitt will have \u201cthe kids over the summer,\u201d and he\u2019s \u201cmaking plans for visits to London,\u201d where Jolie will be shooting Maleficent 2.\u201d But this tale about how they\u2019ve \u201cdecided to give [their] love another try\u201d is entirely wrong and filled with falsehoods.\n\n\n\nAll six kids will actually be spending the summer with Jolie as she films the Maleficent sequel in the UK, as first reported by People. Meanwhile, Pitt is committed to being in Los Angeles so he can shoot Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Once Upon A Time In Hollywood. It\u2019s also impossible for them to have had \u201chookups\u201d over the last few weeks. Pitt was seen in LA last week, but Jolie has been with the children in England. In fact, she\u2019s been in London since at least May 17, so she certainly hasn\u2019t been having rendezvous with Pitt in California.\n\n\n\nAnd opposed to \u201ccalling off\u201d their divorce, the exes are still moving forward with a permanent split. Their plans to dissolve the marriage, however, have been held up because Pitt and Jolie are still at odds over a custody agreement. In fact, E! _ recently described her as \u201cfurious\u201d over the situation. That\u2019s a far cry from getting back together.\n\n\n\nConclusion: The Globe claims Jolie and Pitt are \u201ccalling off\u201d their divorce, but they\u2019re actually still negotiating custody arrangements. While the tabloid alleges the former couple has recently been engaging in \u201chookups,\u201d they\u2019ve really been on separate continents. Plus, the magazine also wrongly asserts the kids are spending the summer in Los Angeles when the reputable People has already reported they\u2019ll be in London. As a result, Gossip Cop has determined this report is completely false.", "images": ["http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/avatars/gallery/newimages/eye7.gif", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif", "http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/assets/gfx/ff/logos/femalefirst.png", "https://media.giphy.com/media/10uG4cPTeBehXi/giphy.gif", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/p/perez-hilton-a1527cbba8e4c1e59cffa4a7d85631ad33bea6ca.jpg", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/avatars/gallery/newimages/eye6.gif", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/square/250/b/bizarre-female-first.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/square/250/x/xmas2019herbalrecoverypackcmykhr.jpg", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/bustingup.gif", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/m/madonna-1f98f322675350ce7b763a92ba5417bd65878b79.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/k/kristin-chenoweth-5b5e2ebbaba7047f29f1ecc4ac0a3b2761a1a6da.jpg", "https://a.collective-media.net/seg/etu/1b", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/roflmao.gif", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/laughingup.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/p/perez-hilton-a1527cbba8e4c1e59cffa4a7d85631ad33bea6ca.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/viewtopic.php?t=752229", "title": "Female First Forum", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk", "summary": ""}
