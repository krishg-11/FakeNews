This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGetty Images\n\n\"We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship. Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly.\"\n\nRead next OMG!

We're not entirely sure why Jen would go back to Brad, who reportedly cheated on her with Angelina Jolie, after all these years, but each to their own.\n\nRead next 'I find myself isolating.

Well, according to reports, their main disagreement was about where they should live.\n\nA source told Entertainment Tonight that Justin couldn't hack living in Hollywood and that Jen wouldn't give up her privacy to live in New York.\n\n\"He much prefers being [in New York] and that's been a major issue for them for a long time. Justin has a very diverse friend group, and he likes that they're not all 'in the industry. He's friends with people in the restaurant world, writers, comedians, artists, tattoo artists. It's an eclectic group and he doesn't have that type of network in LA.\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nRead next Jennifer Aniston just gave a rare look at her natural hair texture and we can't get enough Jennifer Aniston Jennifer Aniston just gave a rare look at her natural hair texture and we can't get enough Into it.\n\nJen's hounded by paparazzi everywhere she goes, whereas Justin can still travel about relatively unnoticed, which of course, posed an issue for them.\n\n\"Justin can hop on his [motorcycle], walk in the neighbourhood, hang at a bar and all that without being bothered, but for Jen, the paparazzi are all over her. He really wanted her to be comfortable [in New York]. He even negotiated with the paps to make a deal that they would only shoot her once per day and then leave her alone. He also agreed to move out of his apartment, which he loves.\"\n\nThey then apparently moved into an apartment in the West Village, but it just wasn't working. The location of a park across the road provided paps with the ideal location to snap Jen as she came and went from her home. This also irked the neighbours, adding more tension to the drama.\n\n\"...What really pissed off the neighbours was just the constant commotion outside their door all the time with the photographers. It made for an awkward living situation for Jen and Justin because they knew the neighbours weren't happy.\"\n\nThen, it gets weird, with a tidbit known as 'the bologna incident'. Apparently, Justin came downstairs one day to find that his motorcycle had been covered in slices of bologna (Italian sausage to you and I), and Jen was convinced that the neighbours had done it. It almost seems too farfetched to be untrue, to be honest, but we'll let you make your own mind up.\n\nRead next Jennifer Aniston is sick of people saying 'you look great for your age' Jennifer Aniston Jennifer Aniston is sick of people saying 'you look great for your age' The Morning Show star talks moisturizer, unrealistic beauty ideals, and more.\n\nDespite their differences, the couple really wanted it to work.

Justin was always really protective of her. They both wanted this to work.\"\n\nHere's a look back on their relationship...\n\nTheir meeting\n\nAfter her five-year marriage ended to Brad Pitt in 2005, Jennifer Aniston became the poster girl for single women everywhere.\n\nShe dated several high profile celebrities including Vince Vaughn, Paul Sculfor, John Mayer and Bradley Cooper and finally found love again falling for Justin Theroux.\n\nRead next The Morning Show will finally make you stop seeing Jennifer Aniston as Rachel Green Jennifer Aniston The Morning Show will finally make you stop seeing Jennifer Aniston as Rachel Green \u201cThis is the best I've ever seen her,\u201d says director Mimi Leder.\n\nThe pair met in 2007 on the set of Tropic Thunder, which Justin co-wrote with Jen's close friend, Ben Stiller. Nothing happened for three years although she admitted even then he had made an impression on her.\n\nShe told Popsugar: \"I thought he was very sweet and he was always very nice.\"\n\n\"But I remember thinking he was very dark. At first, you think he could be like a serial killer, but he is actually the nicest person in the world.\"\n\nSecond chance\n\nThe pair got a second shot at romance when they were filming Wanderlust in 2010 together. Justin was still dating stylist Heidi Bivens but the pair became good friends.\n\nThey were spotted together in May 2011 before they took their relationship public in June at the MTV Movie Awards afterparty.\n\nRead next You can still buy the MAC lipstick Jennifer Aniston wore on the set of Friends Jennifer Aniston You can still buy the MAC lipstick Jennifer Aniston wore on the set of Friends 90s nostalgia.\n\nJustin was the first person Jennifer had dated seriously since John Mayer in 2009.\n\nThe proposal\n\nJennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux got engaged during a romantic break to Rome.\n\nA rep for Theroux revealed that the screenwriter and actor popped the question to the Friends star on his 41st birthday.\n\nSpeaking to People, his publicist said: \"Justin Theroux had an amazing birthday on Friday, receiving an extraordinary gift when his girlfriend, Jennifer Aniston, accepted his proposal of marriage.\"\n\nSpeaking about the interest in his new fiancee's love life, Justin said: \"I understand the curiosity [about me and Jen], but other than saying I am happy, I am not going to indulge it.\"\n\nRead next Jennifer Aniston calls out Harvey Weinstein for his \u2018entitled\u2019 behaviour towards her Jennifer Aniston Jennifer Aniston calls out Harvey Weinstein for his \u2018entitled\u2019 behaviour towards her Jennifer Aniston opens up about her dealings with the former movie mogul.\n\nBradley Cooper congratulated Jen Jennifer Aniston following her engagement to Justin Theroux.
