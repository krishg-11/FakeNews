The insider adds that police arrived to peacefully sort out the situation.\n\nImage zoom Stefania Orru/All Things Fam & Glam\n\nThe couple\u2019s 3-month-old son, Shai, was in the home at the time.\n\nAn LAPD spokesman described the incident as a \u201ccivil dispute,\u201d telling PEOPLE that officers responded to the 1500 block of Sunset Plaza Drive between 1:30 and 2 a.m. but made no arrests because \u201cthere was no crime.\u201d\n\nA police spokeswoman tells PEOPLE that officers suggested that all parties involved should handle the situation in \u201ccivil court.\u201d\n\nAnother official says that the incident was likely a \u201cbusiness dispute,\u201d noting that there was no report taken because no crime was committed.\n\nChmerkovskiy\u2019s DWTS partner, Heather Morris, initially broke the news during a Tuesday appearance on Good Morning America following her Monday night elimination, revealing that Chmerkovskiy could not do the interview with her because of the alleged incident.\n\n\u201cThey had some sort of run-in with some man near their house trying to break in, but the police were there,\u201d Morris, 30, said. \u201cThey took care of it. So they\u2019re safe and Peta\u2019s okay. That\u2019s the most important thing.\u201d\n\nThe incident comes just months after the lovebirds welcomed their first child.\n\nIn the month\u2019s leading up to little Shai\u2019s Jan. 4 birth, the couple went all out designing the baby\u2019s nursery \u2014 which is positioned just off the master bedroom in the couple\u2019s New Jersey home.\n\n\u2018DWTS\u201d Peta Murgatroyd Reveals She Wanted To Put Wedding To Maksim Chmerkovskiy \u2018On Hold\u2019\n\n\u201cWe wanted him to be comfortable and settled in his little corner of the world,\u201d Murgatroyd told PEOPLE then.\n\nChmerkovskiy and Murgatroyd initially worked hard to keep the little boy from prying eyes, with Chmerkovskiy even warning paparazzi in an Instagram post earlier this year.\n\nThey officially revealed little Shai in February, taking to Good Morning America in their first public appearance as a family.\n\n\u201cWe just wanted to keep him for ourselves,\u201d Murgatroyd said then. \u201cIt\u2019s not about me anymore. It\u2019s all about Shai. It\u2019s amazing. I\u2019m okay with it.\u201d\n\nMurgatroyd and Chmerkovskiy became engaged in December 2015 and are planning a summer 2017 wedding.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/peta-murgatroyd.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/56ee470e654daedf74f2c6e5b8b70f2a?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/peta-murgatroyd-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3fa541db8026dac32c501e873a116a3c?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/peta-murgatroyd.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Patrick Gomez", "Char Adams"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/maksim-chmerkovskiy-peta-murgatroyd-okay-after-intruder-attempted-break-in-home/", "title": "Maksim Chmerkovskiy, Peta Murgatroyd & Baby Are 'All Okay' After Intruder Tried to Break into Their L.A.
