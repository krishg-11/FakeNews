Thank you @mikewillmadeit for creating #Bangerz that changed my life 4evr! Love u always.\u201d Interestingly, Cyrus\u2019 praise comes a few weeks after she seemed to want to distance herself from the Bangerz era.\n\n\u201cWe Can\u2019t Stop\u201d was released on June 3, 2013 as the lead single for Cyrus\u2019 Bangerz album. Mike Will co-wrote the song and produced it, as he did for most tracks on the album, which was released in full that October. The first single peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and has since gone triple platinum with more than three million sales.\n\nMiley Cyrus is thanking Mike Will Made-It on the fourth anniversary of their hit song, \u201cWe Can\u2019t Stop.\u201d On Saturday, the pop star credited the rapper-producer and the track with changing her life.\n\nAs Gossip Cop reported, in May Cyrus told Billboard that she\u2019s lost interest in certain types of rap and hip-hop music. \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018Come sit on my d**k, suck on my c**k.\u2019 I can\u2019t listen to that anymore. That\u2019s what pushed me out of the hip-hop scene a little. It was too much \u2018Lamborghini, got my Rolex, got a girl on my c*ck.\u2019 I am so not that,\u201d she told the magazine.\n\nThe singer also addressed accusations of cultural appropriation, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s mind-boggling to me that there was even a controversy around me having black dancers. That became a thing, where people said I was taking advantage of black culture, and with Mike. What the f*ck? That wasn\u2019t true. Those were the dancers I liked!\u201d\n\nAfter the interview was released, Cyrus was ripped on social media by those who thought she only used the hop-hop community for fame with the Bangerz album, and was now distancing herself from what she previously embraced. In a response to the backlash, Cyrus insisted, \u201cI respect ALL artists who speak their truth and appreciate ALL genres of music (country, pop alternative\u2026 but in this particular interview I was asked about rap.\u201d\n\nAs her new tribute to \u201cWe Can\u2019t Stop\u201d indicates, she does still hold that song in high regard. As Gossip Cop reported, Cyrus included the track in her \u201cToday\u201d show concert last month. That said, Mike Will is not believed to be involved with the star\u2019s upcoming album.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=270798540384083&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6036262&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/246754e0a03b7234b410272fccbc1fa5?ops=gravity(%22center%22),maxcontain(96,60)", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/3d87b979-b07b-4349-894d-492d922dea2c", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59355f50025d9ae92c1662ed", "http://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/57d1caf936ce620b3fa9e66f", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/593851b5340308420f595df7?ops=max(120,120),quality(85)", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/246754e0a03b7234b410272fccbc1fa5?ops=gravity(%22center%22),maxcontain(158,100),quality(90)"], "top_img": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59355f50025d9ae92c1662ed", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Shari Weiss"], "canonical_link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-06-05-miley-cyrus-thanks-mike-will-made-it-on-fourth-anniversary-of-we-cant-stop/", "title": "Miley Cyrus Thanks Mike Will Made-It On Fourth Anniversary Of 'We Can\u2019t Stop'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Miley Cyrus is thanking Mike Will Made-It on the fourth anniversary of their hit song, \u201cWe Can\u2019t Stop.\u201d", "thumbnail": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59355f50025d9ae92c1662ed", "keywords": "Miley Cyrus (42281),Mike Will Made-It (933035)", "og": {"title": "Miley Cyrus Thanks Mike Will Made-It On Fourth Anniversary Of 'We Can\u2019t Stop' | iHeartRadio Countdown Blog | 103.7 The Q", "type": "article", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59355f50025d9ae92c1662ed", "url": "https://1037theq.iheart.com/featured/iheartradio-countdown-blog/content/2017-06-05-miley-cyrus-thanks-mike-will-made-it-on-fourth-anniversary-of-we-cant-stop/", "description": "Miley Cyrus is thanking Mike Will Made-It on the fourth anniversary of their hit song, \u201cWe Can\u2019t Stop.\u201d", "site_name": "iHeartRadio Countdown Blog", "locale": "en_US"}, "fb": {"app_id": 195502630484729}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://1037theq.iheart.com/featured/iheartradio-countdown-blog/content/2017-06-05-miley-cyrus-thanks-mike-will-made-it-on-fourth-anniversary-of-we-cant-stop/", "site": "@ihrcountdown", "creator": "@ihrcountdown", "description": "Miley Cyrus is thanking Mike Will Made-It on the fourth anniversary of their hit song, \u201cWe Can\u2019t Stop.\u201d", "title": "Miley Cyrus Thanks Mike Will Made-It On Fourth Anniversary Of 'We Can\u2019t Stop' | iHeartRadio Countdown Blog | 103.7 The Q", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59355f50025d9ae92c1662ed", "domain": "1037theq.iheart.com"}, "parsely-title": "Miley Cyrus Thanks Mike Will Made-It On Fourth Anniversary Of 'We Can\u2019t Stop' | iHeartRadio Countdown Blog | 103.7 The Q", "parsely-link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-06-05-miley-cyrus-thanks-mike-will-made-it-on-fourth-anniversary-of-we-cant-stop/", "parsely-image-url": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59355f50025d9ae92c1662ed", "parsely-tags": "Miley Cyrus (42281),Mike Will Made-It (933035)", "parsely-type": "post", "application-name": "iHeartRadio Countdown Blog", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59355f50025d9ae92c1662ed", "google-site-verification": "p2FWrUKxtwBmQgHV4CjD80oKdZZBjmMNByoWvZMsYso", "msvalidate.01": "E98E323249F89ACF6294F958692E230B", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-06-05 08:41:00-05:00", "parsely-author": "Shari Weiss", "parsely-section": "trending-urban"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1496635200.0, "source": "http://1037theq.iheart.com", "summary": ""}
