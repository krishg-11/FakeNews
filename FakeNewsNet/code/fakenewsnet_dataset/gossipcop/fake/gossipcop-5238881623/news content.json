Announced two days after the president\u2019s rally in Phoenix, the pardon comes before Arpaio, who spoke at last year\u2019s Republican National Convention, has even been sentenced following his July conviction of criminal contempt for disregarding a court order in a racial profiling case. In defense of the move, the administration is citing Arpaio\u2019s long history of military and law enforcement service.\n\nTrump's Arpaio pardon comes in the middle of a Cat-4 hurricane making landfall on a Friday night: pic.twitter.com/rYNjRQ5iu1 \u2014 Abby D.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 26, 2017\n\nThe Arpaio pardon comes on the heels of Trump officially putting into place his ban of transgender people serving in the military, and simultaneously, as controversial White House aide Sebastian Gorka resigned.\n\nMany celebrities and political figures strongly criticized the moves and their timing on social media, calling the president a \u201cracist,\u201d \u201cmonster,\u201d and \u201cdisgusting.\u201d\n\n\u201cTransgender Ban & Arpaio pardon on the same day, hiding behind the news of Hurricane Harvey,\u201d tweeted House of Cards creator Beau Willimon. \u201c@realDonaldTrump is a hateful, cowardly menace.\u201d\n\nTransgender Ban & Arpaio pardon on the same day, hiding behind the news of Hurricane Harvey. @realDonaldTrump is a hateful, cowardly menace. https://t.co/u2NxsXMYXi \u2014 Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) August 26, 2017\n\nRead more reactions below.\n\nThank you @realdonaldtrump for seeing my conviction for what it is: a political witch hunt by holdovers in the Obama justice department! \u2014 Joe Arpaio (@RealSheriffJoe) August 26, 2017\n\nPardon Cosby next.

Granting a pardon to Joe Arpaio is shameful and appalling. \u2014 Sen. Al Franken (@SenFranken) August 26, 2017\n\nThe thousands of people terrorized and brutalized by Arpaio's illegal actions deserve justice.
