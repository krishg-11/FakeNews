I just root for that person to find a little joy.\u201d\n\nShe also explained that the way she decides to make a difference in the world is by trying to change her outlook. And by not letting things get to her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m never going to change things by sitting in my living room bawling. That\u2019s not going to fix or help anything.\"\n\nShe talked about raising her daughters in this kind of world, where people can (and will!) say whatever they want:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same thing I tell my girls, \u2018If somebody is being mean, they\u2019re probably really not happy... If you\u2019re having a great day, you don\u2019t walk past someone and yell, \u2018Freak!\u2019 If you\u2019re happy, you say, \u2018I love your skirt!\u2019\"\n\nWhat's really amazing, though, is that her positive outlook definitely affects the way people see her. If you scroll through Melissa's Instagram comments, there are FAR more positive comments than negative.\n\nAnd that's probably due to the fact that she doesn't feed into any of them! Way to go Melissa, I'm definitely going to live my life a little more like you.\n\n\n\n\n\nGet more from Producer Erica taking over for Sisanie here!\n\nPhoto: Getty Images", "images": ["https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/5d7b93da73adf6b48cc355f3?ops=gravity(%22center%22),maxcontain(158,100),quality(90)", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=270798540384083&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6036262&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/5d7b93da73adf6b48cc355f3?ops=gravity(%22center%22),maxcontain(96,60)", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/3d87b979-b07b-4349-894d-492d922dea2c", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/60cf98c132eb40cc9ffe14e4837fc322?ops=max(120,120),quality(85)", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5af31d0b667c9a394dcc18c7?ops=max(650,0),quality(80)", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5af31d0b667c9a394dcc18c7"], "top_img": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5af31d0b667c9a394dcc18c7", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erica Sullivan"], "canonical_link": "https://news.iheart.com/featured/sisanie/content/2018-05-09-melissa-mccarthy-on-why-she-roots-for-online-trolls/", "title": "Melissa McCarthy On Why She 'Roots For' Online Trolls", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "She really has the best outlook!", "thumbnail": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5af31d0b667c9a394dcc18c7", "keywords": "Melissa McCarthy", "og": {"title": "Melissa McCarthy On Why She 'Roots For' Online Trolls | Sisanie | iHeartRadio", "type": "article", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5af31d0b667c9a394dcc18c7", "url": "https://news.iheart.com/featured/sisanie/content/2018-05-09-melissa-mccarthy-on-why-she-roots-for-online-trolls/", "description": "She really has the best outlook!", "site_name": "Sisanie", "locale": "en_US"}, "fb": {"app_id": 121897277851831}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://news.iheart.com/featured/sisanie/content/2018-05-09-melissa-mccarthy-on-why-she-roots-for-online-trolls/", "site": "@sisanie", "creator": "@sisanie", "description": "She really has the best outlook!", "title": "Melissa McCarthy On Why She 'Roots For' Online Trolls | Sisanie | iHeartRadio", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5af31d0b667c9a394dcc18c7", "domain": "news.iheart.com"}, "parsely-title": "Melissa McCarthy On Why She 'Roots For' Online Trolls | Sisanie | iHeartRadio", "parsely-link": "https://news.iheart.com/featured/sisanie/content/2018-05-09-melissa-mccarthy-on-why-she-roots-for-online-trolls/", "parsely-image-url": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5af31d0b667c9a394dcc18c7", "parsely-tags": "Melissa McCarthy", "parsely-type": "post", "application-name": "Sisanie", "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5af31d0b667c9a394dcc18c7", "google-site-verification": "p2FWrUKxtwBmQgHV4CjD80oKdZZBjmMNByoWvZMsYso", "msvalidate.01": "E98E323249F89ACF6294F958692E230B", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-05-09 12:01:00-04:00", "parsely-author": "Erica Sullivan", "parsely-section": "Sisanie Blog (5507)"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525838400.0, "source": "http://news.iheart.com", "summary": ""}
