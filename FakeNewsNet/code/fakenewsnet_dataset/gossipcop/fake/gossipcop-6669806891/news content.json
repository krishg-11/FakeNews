I mean Santa!\"\n\nJim Carrey's concerns about a push towards a Devil-worshipping future may not actually be so far-fetched.\n\nFor generations, Illuminati symbolism has been subliminally pushed though pop culture, but more recently there has been a dramatic rise of Satanic symbols in music.\n\nCelebrities, from Nicki Minaj to Lil Wayne to Rihanna, are accused of filling the airwaves with Illuminati imagery.\n\nIn music videos, promotional materials, video games, and paparazzi photos, the most famous guys and girls in pop culture are caught repping the All-Seeing Eye.\n\nThis eye, a singular eyeball in a pyramid-esque shape, is associated with this occult group of Satanists who have sold their souls for success.\n\nTurn on the MTV VMAs for Illuminati symbolism, courtesy of Lady Gaga and Miley Cyrus.\n\nScroll through old album covers and find one-eyed Jordin Sparks and Celine Dion confirming their membership in the occult organization.\n\nTurn the pages of Parlour magazine and Esquire to see Katy Perry and Nicki Minaj use triangular mannerisms to cover one eye.\n\nThe Eye of Horus isn't even disguised as the CBS logo, nor is it disguised in scenes from the hit video game \"Grand Theft Auto V.\"\n\nLook close enough, and Illuminati Eyes sightings are all over pop culture.\n\nIlluminati symbols in pop culture aren't uncommon, but now they are becoming more frequent and less subtle.\n\nJay-Z wears a Satanic slogan across his sweatshirt: 'Do What Thou Wilt'\n\n\u00a9 press\n\nRecently music stars have become far more open about their devotion to the occult and their love for their \"Lord Satan.\"\n\nJust last month, Hip Hop star Jay-Z has blasted traditional Christian values in an epic rant where he claims to be part of an exclusive club of \"smart people\" who worships \"our true lord; Satan.\"\n\nThe billionaire rapper has also claimed that \"God created Lucifer to be the bearer of truth and light,\" and that \"Jesus never existed\" but was merely a \"tool created by smart people to control dumb people.\"\n\nMore recently, pop star Miley Cyrus left her followers shocked and confused after advising her young fans to \"worship Satan\" if they want to become \"rich & famous\" like their heroes.\n\nIf what Carrey is saying is correct, then maybe these revelations aren't accidental slip-ups at all but are meant to be an intentional push at taking their Satanic teachings into the mainstream.\n\nFox has invested millions into pro-Satanic programming like TV show 'Lucifer'\n\n\u00a9 press\n\nTV network Fox has also being accused of trying to \"take the Devil mainstream\" after investing millions into pro-Satanic programming.\n\nOne of Fox's most popular shows, Lucifer, depicts a cool, good-looking incarnation of the devil who drives a Corvette and owns a nightclub.\n\nThe series makes the idea of Satan seem exciting, and clearly being aimed at teenagers and young adults, it certainly fits in with Carrey's brainwashing comments.\n\nFox has also heavily promoted a show that's a modern reinvention of William Peter Blatty\u2019s bestselling 1971 book, The Exorcist.\n\nThe project is described as \"a propulsive, serialized psychological thriller following two very different men tackling one family\u2019s case of horrifying demonic possession, and confronting the face of true evil.\"\n\nRupert Murdoch\u2019s media conglomerate News Corp., that owns Fox, also owns a company called Avon that publishes and promotes Anton Lavey\u2019s book The Satanic Bible.\n\nIf the Illuminati is trying to push Satanism onto the public, then the signs are all there.\n\nAnd, if there are trying to influence the beliefs of future generations, then pushing Satanic values through popular culture would certainly be the most effective way to brainwash young minds.\n\nPeople often assume that Jim Carrey is either joking or crazy when he makes statements that most people are unable to decipher, yet in this case, and many others, it seems as though he's making more sense than ever.", "images": ["https://p0.ipstatp.com/list/pgc-image-va/Rk7qYgb7X1avER.jpg", "https://p0.ipstatp.com/list/pgc-image-va/Rk80gpc2rcEZyN.jpg", "https://p0.ipstatp.com/list/pgc-image-va/Rk7se7r64K3f1F.jpg", "https://www.kuyun9.com/https://img3.doubanio.com/view/photo/s_ratio_poster/public/p2564830580.jpg", "https://p0.ipstatp.com/large/005a2713ede300930582", "http://pic.szjal.cn/img/5d9b754a829b6.jpg", "https://p0.ipstatp.com/list/pgc-image-va/Reso4VMB1zm4pz.jpg", "http://www.twoeggz.com/res/images/logo.png", "https://p0.ipstatp.com/large/005a0acfe6d840a470c8", "https://p0.ipstatp.com/list/pgc-image-va/Rk7oWNe2UFXzRb.jpg", "http://www.twoeggz.com/pic/int/2017-12-06/2a57187c75bda7c98a7a52de04edb5e8.jpg", "https://p0.ipstatp.com/list/pgc-image-va/Rk87bMq7SsMPBL.jpg", "https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/H04074dfb83e24f1e9a18521862bd2cd4b.jpg", "https://p0.ipstatp.com/large/005a2713ee1000927ee0", "https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/H3e8b817d0e474f47ba906a89e037fefdk.jpg", "http://pic.iqiyi6123.com/upload/vod/2019-12-10/15759449164.jpg", "https://p0.ipstatp.com/list/pgc-image-va/Rk86cGK2mt7jCD.jpg", "https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/Hcbcdb344c19849c2a63775a6ad520c5e1.jpg", "https://p0.ipstatp.com/list/undefined.jpg", "https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/H4daf82ce44134673a00043d8d467249aK.jpg", "https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/Hc430827999154e8fb810d6e45910f358s.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www.twoeggz.com/pic/int/2017-12-06/2a57187c75bda7c98a7a52de04edb5e8.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "Jim Carrey: 'The Illuminati is Brainwashing Children into Worshipping Satan'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Jim Carrey: 'The Illuminati is Brainwashing Children into Worshipping Satan'", "description": "Hollywood star says entertainment industry is pushing Satanism\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nJim Carrey says the Illuminati is pushing Satanism through the entertainmen", "image": "/pic/int/2017-12-06/2a57187c75bda7c98a7a52de04edb5e8.jpg"}, "keywords": "Jim,Carrey:,''The,Illuminati,is,Brainwashing,Children,into,Worshipping,Satan''", "description": "Hollywood star says entertainment industry is pushing Satanism\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nJim Carrey says the Illuminati is pushing Satanism through the entertainmen"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.twoeggz.com", "summary": ""}
