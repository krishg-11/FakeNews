Elgort was also nominated for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy for playing the part of getaway driver baby in Baby Driver. He lost out to James Franco in The Disaster Artist.\n\nBased on the novel by John Green, The Fault in Our Stars tells the story of a 16-year-old girl with cancer (Woodley) who meets and falls for 17-year-old Augustus Waters (Elgort), an ex-basketball player and amputee.\n\nDespite neither winning an accolade, the duo seemed happy enough just bumping into one another in the ballroom and cuddled up for a snap.\n\n\u201cShe deserves all happiness in the world,\u201d Elgort wrote on Instagram alongside the image. \u201cTo be in the same room at the Golden Globes with a woman who helped guide me early in my career when she was already a Golden Globe nominee, was a surreal moment. Life coming full circle.\u201d", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/gettyimages-902368084.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/gettyimages-902368084.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c94654c862ed2e07d803b3fe49b1e82a?s=300&d=blank&r=g"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/gettyimages-902368084.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ruth Kinane"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/golden-globes/2018/01/07/ansel-elgort-shailene-woodley-golden-globes-reunion/", "title": "Ansel Elgort and Shailene Woodley had a Fault in Our Stars reunion at the Globes", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "golden globes 2018, the golden globes, watch golden globes, golden globes live, golden globes stream, black golden globes, golden globes nbc, golden globes online, golden globes red carpet, golden globes nominees, the fault in our stars, Shailene Woodley, Ansel Elgort, big little lies, hbo, baby driver", "news_keywords": "golden globes 2018, the golden globes, watch golden globes, golden globes live, golden globes stream, black golden globes, golden globes nbc, golden globes online, golden globes red carpet, golden globes nominees, the fault in our stars, Shailene Woodley, Ansel Elgort, big little lies, hbo, baby driver", "description": "The stars aligned at the Golden Globe Awards on Sunday evening in Los Angles, when the lead actors of emotional\u2026", "og": {"title": "Ansel Elgort and Shailene Woodley had a 'Fault in Our Stars' reunion at the Globes", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/golden-globes/2018/01/07/ansel-elgort-shailene-woodley-golden-globes-reunion/", "description": "The stars aligned at the Golden Globe Awards on Sunday evening in Los Angles, when the lead actors of emotional\u2026", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/gettyimages-902368084.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/golden-globes/2018/01/07/ansel-elgort-shailene-woodley-golden-globes-reunion/", "description": "The stars aligned at the Golden Globe Awards on Sunday evening in Los Angles, when the lead actors of emotional\u2026", "media": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/gettyimages-902368084.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/golden-globes/2018/01/07/ansel-elgort-shailene-woodley-golden-globes-reunion/", "title": "Ansel Elgort and Shailene Woodley had a 'Fault in Our Stars' reunion at the Globes", "description": "The stars aligned at the Golden Globe Awards on Sunday evening in Los Angles, when the lead actors of emotional\u2026", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/gettyimages-902368084.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515301200.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
