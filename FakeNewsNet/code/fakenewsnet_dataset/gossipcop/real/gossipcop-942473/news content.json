The host of CNN\u2019s Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown, who was 61, was found unresponsive in his hotel room in France on Friday morning by close friend and French chef, Eric Ripert, according to CNN. Both were filming an upcoming episode of Bourdain\u2019s award-winning show.\n\nArgento\u2019s recent Instagram story, posted around three hours before Bourdain\u2019s death was first reported, was a photo of herself wearing a ripped t-shirt that read: \u201cF\u2014 EVERYONE.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know who you are,\u201d she captioned the post.\n\nArgento\u2019s Instagram story has since been deleted.\n\nImage zoom Asia Argento/Instagram\n\nRELATED: Rose McGowan Mourns the Loss of Friend Anthony Bourdain in Teary Video: \u2018I\u2019m So Mad at You\u2019\n\nArgento has since released a statement regarding Bourdain on Twitter. \u201cAnthony gave all of himself in everything that he did,\u201d she said. \u201cHis brilliant, fearless spirit touched and inspired so many, and his generosity knew no bounds. He was my love, my rock, my protector. I am beyond devastated. My thoughts are with his family. I would ask that you respect their privacy and mine.\u201d\n\nA Strasbourg police spokesperson confirmed Bourdain\u2019s death to PEOPLE. Colmar, France, public prosecutor Christian de Rocquigny du Fayel told PEOPLE that Bourdain died by hanging at a luxury hotel in Kaysersberg called Le Chambard, noting \u201cat this stage, nothing suggests the intervention of a third party.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is with extraordinary sadness we can confirm the death of our friend and colleague, Anthony Bourdain,\u201d CNN said in a statement. \u201cHis love of great adventure, new friends, fine food and drink and the remarkable stories of the world made him a unique storyteller. His talents never ceased to amaze us and we will miss him very much. Our thoughts and prayers are with his daughter and family at this incredibly difficult time.\u201d\n\nArgento and Bourdain met when the two collaborated on the Rome episode of Parts Unknown in 2016, and Argento became heavily involved in his creative process. She recently directed an upcoming episode set in Hong Kong, and Bourdain would often consult her for her rich knowledge of music and film when putting together the series.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Anthony Bourdain, Celebrated American Chef, Dead at 61 from Apparent Suicide\n\nSpeaking to PEOPLE earlier this year, Bourdain opened up about how he made long-distance work with the Rome-based actress amid his hectic travel schedule.\n\n\u201cI want to spend as much time with her as I can,\u201d he said, explaining that he reserved about five days a month to spend with Ariane, his 11-year-old daughter with his ex-wife Ottavia Busia in New York, followed by trips to visit Argento in Italy.\n\nRELATED: Anthony Bourdain Joked He Wanted to \u2018Die in the Saddle\u2019 in PEOPLE Interview Months Before Death\n\nAsked if her presence has made him softer on and off set, Bourdain said, \u201cI\u2019m happier for sure. It\u2019s nice to be with somebody who I see as a peer.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been in this circus since she was nine,\u201d he said. \u201cShe knows so much more about so many of the things that are important to me \u2014 music, books, film, the technical aspects of film, and just the weird state of celebrity, being somebody that people come up to. That\u2019s something she\u2019s dealt with a lot longer than me. I was 44 before that started happening. Whereas, it\u2019s been like that for her since she was a kid.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis woman likes to work,\u201d he continued. \u201cShe is strong, independent, creative, and needs to have an obsession, needs to make things. I think we\u2019re both relieved by the fact that we both respect each other\u2019s work. Nobody\u2019s ever going to say, \u2018Oh, but you promised we were going to go to the beach.\u2019 No, you get a gig, that\u2019s it. Work first.\u201d\n\nArgento\u2019s most recent photo with Bourdain was posted on May 27.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wrap!\u201d she captioned a black and white photo of the two. \u201c#Firenze @partsunknowncnn @anthonybourdain #makearteveryday.\u201d\n\nBourdain also liked a photo Argento posted to Instagram four days before his death.\n\nIf you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/asia-argento-2.jpg?crop=319px%2C0px%2C1678px%2C881px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/asia-argento-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/asia-argento-2.jpg?crop=319px%2C0px%2C1678px%2C881px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aurelie Corinthios"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/food/asia-argento-cryptic-message-before-anthony-bourdain-suicide/", "title": "Anthony Bourdain: Asia Argento Shared Cryptic Message Before His Apparent Suicide", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Anthony Bourdain,Asia Argento,Death,News", "news_keywords": "Anthony Bourdain,Asia Argento,Death,News", "description": "The renowned chef, TV host and author died of apparent suicide at 61", "og": {"title": "Asia Argento Shared Cryptic Message Hours Before Anthony Bourdain's Apparent Suicide: 'F\u2014 Everyone...You Know Who You Are'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/food/asia-argento-cryptic-message-before-anthony-bourdain-suicide/", "description": "The renowned chef, TV host and author died of apparent suicide at 61", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/asia-argento-2.jpg?crop=319px%2C0px%2C1678px%2C881px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/food/asia-argento-cryptic-message-before-anthony-bourdain-suicide/", "description": "The renowned chef, TV host and author died of apparent suicide at 61", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/asia-argento-2.jpg?crop=319px%2C0px%2C1678px%2C881px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/food/asia-argento-cryptic-message-before-anthony-bourdain-suicide/", "title": "Asia Argento Shared Cryptic Message Hours Before Anthony Bourdain's Apparent Suicide: 'F\u2014 Everyone...You Know Who You Are'", "description": "The renowned chef, TV host and author died of apparent suicide at 61", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/asia-argento-2.jpg?crop=319px%2C0px%2C1678px%2C881px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
