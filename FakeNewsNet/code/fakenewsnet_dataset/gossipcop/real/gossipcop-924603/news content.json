I have nothing to do with any of that. People should be able to live in peace,\u201d said the hitmaker, who shares 5-year-old son King Cairo with ex-fianc\u00e9e Blac Chyna. (Chyna is also mom to Jenner\u2019s 16-month-old niece Dream Kardashian.)\n\nThe paternity claims first caused a frenzy in November 2017 when Tyga seemingly claimed to be the father of the child.\n\nImage zoom Travis Scott Kylie Jenner/Snapchat\n\nImage zoom Travis Scott and Kylie Jenner INSTARimages.com\n\nJenner and Scott, however, have been enjoying their time both as new parents and a couple.
