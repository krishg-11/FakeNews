Lydia returned to the SoCal crew in Season 12 after having previously spent some time on the show back in Season 8. \u201cRHOC has given me a great platform and I\u2019m grateful for that. However, I feel like I can only handle this show one season at a time,\u201d she wrote in a blog post on Friday (February 9). \u201cI need a break! There is a lot of good that comes from the show, but also a lot of negativity. After a family vote, it was unanimous that I should take a break. Sometimes the people who love us the most see things even we don\u2019t see. I trust my path and I\u2019m excited for what the future holds.\u201d\n\nWhen Season 12 wrapped up, Lydia and her husband, Doug, revealed that they were mulling over plans for them to possibly expand their family with a daughter (more on that in the video below). They are already parents to three sons. In reflecting on her sophomore season on the show, she shared, \"I feel like last time I was with this group of women, I just really observed and I didnt necessarily speak my mind. And this time around, I feel like I really was able to stick up for myself and voice my opinion and I'm proud of myself for that.\"\n\nThis past season, in addition to watching Lydia's home life with her husband and three kids, fans also got to know her mom, Judy Stirling, a little better; watched Lydia expand her Nobleman magazine empire; and also learned a bit more about her family's history as media moguls in her native Canada.\n\nLast month, Meghan King Edmonds revealed her departure from the show.\n\nCheck out more from Lydia on her marriage, below.", "images":
