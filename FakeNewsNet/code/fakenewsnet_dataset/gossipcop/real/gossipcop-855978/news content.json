He\u2019s been a longtime supporter of the festival,\u201d a source close to DiCaprio tells PEOPLE, adding: \u201cHe has a busy few days. He is there to support amfAR and [has] some other meetings around environmental issues.\u201d\n\nThe actor has been a steady presence at the festival over the years, having previously opened The Great Gatsby there in 2013 and attended numerous charity galas, including one in 2015 where he outbid Paris Hilton on a Chanel purse.\n\nDonning his signature flat cap and a button-up shirt with a jacket, DiCaprio took his seat before the likes of Heidi Klum, Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner hit the runway.\n\nImage zoom David Fisher/REX/Shutterstock\n\nThe actor is no stranger to the festival, both for the films and the party circuit.\n\nIn 2011, he attended the festival a week after ending his five-year relationship with model Bar Refaeli. There, DiCaprio was spotted catching up with Blake Lively on a yacht on the French Riviera, and the two were later seen hanging out in Italy once the festival was over.\n\nThree years later, the actor attended the festival with model Toni Garnn, and the two were photographed kissing at the amfAR Cinema Against Aids Gala.\n\nIn 2016, DiCaprio\u2019s Cannes trip came just weeks after he was seen getting cozy with model Roxy Horner in New York City. At Cannes, he was later spotted hitting the dance floor with Victoria\u2019s Secret model Georgia Fowler at the Gotha Club. His romance with Agdal started shortly after.\n\nFor full coverage of the Cannes Film Festival, including the biggest stars and best red carpet moments, check out people.com/cannes-film-festival\n\nFROM PEN: 23 Oscar Nominees Reveal The Untold Stories Behind Their Films\n\nDiCaprio and Agdal had dated for a year after first being spotted at a New York City club in May 2016.
