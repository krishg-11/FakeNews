News, Kardashian West is in the midst of a shopping trip with her friends and crew when an overwhelming crowd of fans and photographers begins to form at the entrance to the store.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I haven\u2019t been shopping in months,\u201d she says. \u201cNot that I even need anything, but I always like to see what stores have in different countries, or if there are special pieces.\u201d\n\nAs she browses the racks and picks out matching purses for her and daughter North West, 3, her friends begin to notice her unease.\n\n\u201cAre you nervous about that crowd?\u201d asks hairstylist Jen Atkin.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d replies Kardashian West. \u201cI just don\u2019t know \u2014 I\u2019m like, afraid of everything. I just get scared.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kim Kardashian West Breaks Down Over Paris Robbery Attack: \u2018That Was So Meant to Happen to Me\u2019\n\n\u201cThis is what I was kind of afraid of \u2014 this feeling of panic,\u201d she explains. \u201cWith so many people gathering, and then they start [posting on] social media, like, \u2018Kim\u2019s at the mall, she\u2019s here,\u2019 \u2014 and then other people will know exactly where I\u2019m at. It gives me such anxiety.\u201d\n\nLuckily, the star and her entourage slip out a back door, averting a crisis and potential panic attack for Kardashian West.\n\nAt the time, a source told PEOPLE the reality star was \u201cnervous\u201d before she left for the trip, but ended up having \u201ca great weekend.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a work trip, but she has been sightseeing a bit as well,\u201d said the source. \u201cShe was nervous before she left, but says it was the right decision. She was excited to spend time with her fans.\u201d\n\nKeeping Up with the Kardashians airs Sundays (9 p.m. ET) on E!", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/kim-kardashian15.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/kim-kardashian15.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aurelie Corinthios"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/kim-kardashian-panics-during-shopping-trip-dubai-post-robbery-keeping-up-with-kardashians/", "title": "Kim Kardashian West Panics During Rare Post-Robbery Public Outing: 'I'm Afraid of Everything'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "kim kardashian, kim kardashian west, kim kardashian in dubai, keeping up with the kardashians", "news_keywords": "kim kardashian, kim kardashian west, kim kardashian in dubai, keeping up with the kardashians", "description": "Keeping Up with the Kardashians airs Sundays (9 p.m. ET) on E!", "og": {"title": "Kim Kardashian West Panics During Rare Post-Robbery Public Outing: 'I'm Afraid of Everything'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/kim-kardashian-panics-during-shopping-trip-dubai-post-robbery-keeping-up-with-kardashians/", "description": "Keeping Up with the Kardashians airs Sundays (9 p.m. ET) on E!", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/kim-kardashian15.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/kim-kardashian-panics-during-shopping-trip-dubai-post-robbery-keeping-up-with-kardashians/", "description": "Keeping Up with the Kardashians airs Sundays (9 p.m. ET) on E!", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/kim-kardashian15.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/kim-kardashian-panics-during-shopping-trip-dubai-post-robbery-keeping-up-with-kardashians/", "title": "Kim Kardashian West Panics During Rare Post-Robbery Public Outing: 'I'm Afraid of Everything'", "description": "Keeping Up with the Kardashians airs Sundays (9 p.m. ET) on E!", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/kim-kardashian15.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
