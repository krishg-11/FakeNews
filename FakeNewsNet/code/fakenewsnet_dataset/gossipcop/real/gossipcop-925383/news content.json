News: \u201cYou know, I would, if there was something to remove cellulite I would totally do it\u2026It doesn\u2019t exist though.\u201d\n\nThe 44-year-old explained that she \u201calways had cellulite\u201d and it continues to be an \u201cinsecurity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I walked down the Victoria\u2019s Secret runway, I always covered my butt. Always,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople used to think, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s one of the top angels. That\u2019s why she has a long train or extra.\u2019 No, I was covering up my cellulite. Thank you Victoria\u2019s Secret for working with me, they knew why I was doing it.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Christopher Polk/Getty\n\nUltimately, Banks is hoping to encourage a more honest conversation about looks.\n\n\u201cFix it or flaunt it \u2014 I think women should be able to do both,\u201d she recently told PEOPLE. \u201cThere is a boundary line, either you\u2019re super natural or you live at the plastic surgeon. It\u2019s okay to hop back and forth over that line. You want a hair weave? Fine. You want permanent eyebrows? Fine. We as women need to stop judging.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/tyra-banks.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1264px%2C663.6px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/tyra-banks.jpg"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/tyra-banks.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1264px%2C663.6px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michelle Ward Trainor"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/health/tyra-banks-cosmetic-surgery-cellulite/", "title": "Tyra Banks Reveals Cellulite Has Always Been an 'Insecurity'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "tyra banks, tyra banks cellulite, tyra banks body, tyra banks plastic surgery, tyra banks book, perfect is boring, tyra banks perfect is boring", "news_keywords": "tyra banks, tyra banks cellulite, tyra banks body, tyra banks plastic surgery, tyra banks book, perfect is boring, tyra banks perfect is boring", "description": "Tyra Banks opens up about having cellulite, and said she would get it removed if she could", "og": {"title": "Tyra Banks Reveals Cellulite Has Always Been an 'Insecurity'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/health/tyra-banks-cosmetic-surgery-cellulite/", "description": "Tyra Banks opens up about having cellulite, and said she would get it removed if she could", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/tyra-banks.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1264px%2C663.6px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/health/tyra-banks-cosmetic-surgery-cellulite/", "description": "Tyra Banks opens up about having cellulite, and said she would get it removed if she could", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/tyra-banks.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1264px%2C663.6px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/health/tyra-banks-cosmetic-surgery-cellulite/", "title": "Tyra Banks Reveals Cellulite Has Always Been an 'Insecurity'", "description": "Tyra Banks opens up about having cellulite, and said she would get it removed if she could", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/tyra-banks.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1264px%2C663.6px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
