According to E! and the U.K.\u2019s The Times, the prince\u2019s staff is reportedly planning his transition to king. It\u2019s all part of a bigger plan called \u201cProject 70.\u201d We love hearing royal family news, so we\u2019re all ears. (Hey, even the real queen watches The Crown.)\n\nProject 70 refers to Prince Charles becoming king by his 70th birthday.\n\nThat\u2019s not too far away \u2014 Prince Charles turns 70 on November 14, 2018. According to The Times, his staff is \u201ckeen to \u2018accelerate\u2019 plans to increase his involvement in key royal events\u201d by then.\n\nHere\u2019s what that involvement might look like, according to The Times.\n\n\"Prince Charles's team is thought to want him to be more involved in occasions such as the Royal Maundy service. [This is] when the monarch distributes alms to pensioners on the day before Good Friday, and in Commonwealth events.\"\n\nThe idea of Queen Elizabeth not being the queen is practically unimaginable. But she is 91 years old, after all. And Prince Charles has been the heir apparent since February 1952, when Elizabeth became queen.\n\nSo far these reports have been denied by Clarence House, the royal residence of Charles, Prince of Wales.\n\nBut tension has reportedly been afoot amongst our favorite royals.\n\nRumor has it that Prince Charles affected the decision to fire the Queen\u2019s private secretary, Sir Christopher Geidt. This reportedly added to the tension between Clarence House and Buckingham place.\n\nThe two presented a statement that reads:\n\n\"At the time of the announcement, the lord chamberlain paid tribute to the major contribution made by Sir Christopher, who in turn commended the support offered to Her Majesty by other members of the royal family. Recent years have seen an ever-closer working relationship between all the different royal households and their respective teams... Beyond that, we are not going to engage with a story based on rumours from unnamed sources.\"\n\nRight now the tension seems like a lot of rumors and conjecture. Either way, it makes sense that some plans are in place for Charles. With November 14th, 2018 in mind, it should be an interesting year across the pond.", "images": ["https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091645/best-money-apps.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/02/12155159/best-friend-stories.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091648/bestredlipsticks.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/09/16030117/picture-of-prince-charles-photo.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/16020752/avatar-b1-150x150.png"], "top_img": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/09/16030117/picture-of-prince-charles-photo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["P.
