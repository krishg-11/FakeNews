AMC Networks announced Friday that it has a project in development called \u201cKevin Can F*** Himself,\u201d from creator Valerie Armstrong and executive producers Rashida Jones and Will McCormack.\n\nThe series aims to expose \u201cthe secret life of a woman we all grew up watching: the sitcom wife,\u201d the network said in a statement. \u201cA beauty paired with a less attractive, dismissive, caveman-like husband who gets to be a jerk because she\u2019s a nag and he\u2019s \u2018funny.'\" The show aims to illuminate said secret life by switching between \u201csingle-camera realism and multi-camera zaniness.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHayes even tweeted about it:\n\nThis project is the second buzzed about this week that directly challenges long-established Hollywood tropes. The first? \u201cIsn\u2019t It Romantic,\u201d an upcoming movie that centers on a cynical woman (Rebel Wilson) who faces her worst nightmare when she gets trapped in a cheesy romantic comedy. (Yes, the same movie Wilson was promoting when she incorrectly claimed to be the \u201cfirst-ever plus-sized girl\u201d to lead a rom-com.)\n\nAMC opened a writers' room for the sitcom \u2014 as well as workplace drama \u201cRainy Day People\u201d \u2014 under its \u201cscript-to-series\u201d development model, used for projects with promising pilot scripts.\n\n\u201cUnder the approach, AMC foregoes the traditional pilot process and instead opens writers' rooms to develop scripts for several episodes and a detailed look at a potential first season before deciding whether to move to a straight-to-series order,\u201d Deadline reported last year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo while there\u2019s no guarantee \u201cKevin Can F*** Himself\u201d will make it to the finish line, AMC programming president David Madden did note that the network has had \u201cgreat experiences\u201d with the creative team behind it. Things are looking up.
