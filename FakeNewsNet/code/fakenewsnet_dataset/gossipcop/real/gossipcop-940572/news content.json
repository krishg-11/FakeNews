Obviously, we know each other really well,\u201d says Tarek of the former couple\u2019s dynamic as business partners. They\u2019re co-executive producing the series, which he notes they began working on \u201cbefore separation. So it\u2019s been a long, long process.\u201d\n\nBut they\u2019re not simply seeing the project through before parting ways. Tarek tells PEOPLE exclusively, he\u2019s not ruling out the possibility of working together again down the line. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say right now because we\u2019re just letting the dust settle. But I\u2019m always looking for growth, always looking into tomorrow,\u201d he says. \u201cThe future is bright. We\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d\n\nWATCH THIS: Christina and Tarek El Moussa\u2019s Divorce Has Not Stopped Their Business Relationship\n\nChristina and Tarek discovered their proteges at one of their real estate seminars, where Bryan, a former police officer, made sure to leave a lasting impression on the HGTV stars. \u201cWhile we were doing pictures with all the students,\u201d Tarek explains, \u201che comes up to me and shakes my hand and says, \u2018You\u2019re gonna know me.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Okay, nice to meet you,\u2019 and he goes, \u2018No,\u2019 and he wouldn\u2019t let go of my hand, \u2018You are going to know me.\u2019 I thought he was funny. Ten minutes later he comes back. He went back in line again to tell me, \u2018You are gonna know me.'\u201d\n\nAnd he was right. The two connected after the seminar and became fast friends. \u201cI definitely mentored Bryan quite a bit,\u201d Tarek notes. \u201cAnd it\u2019s really worked out. He\u2019s created a really successful business with his wife.\u201d Bryan and Maira take on similar roles to Christina and Tarek, with the guys focussing on construction and the women designing to sell.\n\nIn the premiere alone, they face possible bullet holes in the windows, unsightly facades, and 100 years worth of potential damage \u2014 and that\u2019s all before they step inside.\n\nCheck out the trailer above and watch the premiere of Chi-Town Flip August 6 at 2PM on HGTV.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/tarek-el-moussa.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/editorial-franchise-exclusive.png", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/tarek-el-moussa.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mackenzie Schmidt"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/home/tarek-el-moussa-on-producing-his-first-post-flip-or-flop-show-with-ex-christina-the-future-is-bright/", "title": "Tarek and Christina El Moussa Produce New HGTV Show: Chi-Town Flip", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "christina el moussa, tarek el moussa, flip or flop, chi-town flip, chitown flip, bryan and maira chi-town flip", "news_keywords": "christina el moussa, tarek el moussa, flip or flop, chi-town flip, chitown flip, bryan and maira chi-town flip", "description": "The recently separated stars of Flip or Flop are still working together to produce a new HGTV series", "og": {"title": "Tarek El Moussa on Producing His First Post-Flip or Flop Show with Ex Christina: 'The Future Is Bright'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/home/tarek-el-moussa-on-producing-his-first-post-flip-or-flop-show-with-ex-christina-the-future-is-bright/", "description": "The HGTV stars are executive producing a new series, Chi-Town Flip", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/tarek-el-moussa.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/home/tarek-el-moussa-on-producing-his-first-post-flip-or-flop-show-with-ex-christina-the-future-is-bright/", "description": "The recently separated stars of Flip or Flop are still working together to produce a new HGTV series", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/tarek-el-moussa.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/home/tarek-el-moussa-on-producing-his-first-post-flip-or-flop-show-with-ex-christina-the-future-is-bright/", "title": "Tarek El Moussa on Producing His First Post-Flip or Flop Show with Ex Christina: 'The Future Is Bright'", "description": "The recently separated stars of Flip or Flop are still working together to produce a new HGTV series", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/tarek-el-moussa.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
