The father of two donated $5,000 to Miller\u2019s GoFundMe page.\n\nFour years ago, Tarek was diagnosed with both thyroid cancer and testicular cancer, but only revealed that he was battling the former.\n\n\u201cTesticular cancer is more of a private thing,\u201d he previously told PEOPLE about why he kept it a secret.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/tarek-el-moussa1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/tarek-el-moussa1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/tarek-el-moussa1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alexia Fernandez"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/tarek-christina-el-moussa-contractor-dies/", "title": "Tarek and Christina El Moussa Mourn Death of Flip or Flop Contractor", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "tarek el moussa, christina el moussa, tv watch, news, celebrities, death", "news_keywords": "tarek el moussa, christina el moussa, tv watch, news, celebrities, death", "description": "Tarek & Christina El Moussa are mourning the death of one of their close friends, Frank Miller, a contractor for Flip or Flop", "og": {"title": "Tarek and Christina El Moussa Mourn Death of Flip or Flop Contractor", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/tarek-christina-el-moussa-contractor-dies/", "description": "Tarek & Christina El Moussa are mourning the death of one of their close friends, Frank Miller, a contractor for Flip or Flop", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/tarek-el-moussa1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/tarek-christina-el-moussa-contractor-dies/", "description": "Tarek & Christina El Moussa are mourning the death of one of their close friends, Frank Miller, a contractor for Flip or Flop", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/tarek-el-moussa1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/tarek-christina-el-moussa-contractor-dies/", "title": "Tarek and Christina El Moussa Mourn Death of Flip or Flop Contractor", "description": "Tarek & Christina El Moussa are mourning the death of one of their close friends, Frank Miller, a contractor for Flip or Flop", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/tarek-el-moussa1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
