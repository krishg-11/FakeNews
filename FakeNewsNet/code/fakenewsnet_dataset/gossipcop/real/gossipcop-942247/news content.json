Bella previously told PEOPLE that she\u2019s been in \u201ccommunication\u201d with the pro wrestler and that they were taking steps to get back together.\n\nOn May 19, the two were spotted out together for the first since their split.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re basically back together,\u201d a second source close to the situation told PEOPLE at the time. \u201cThey never stopped talking. Other than the actual wedding weekend, when they took some space, they have been talking.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Nikki Bella Wishes John Cena Would\u2019ve Called Instead Of Discussing Breakup On \u2018The Today Show\u2019\n\nSources had previously said that her decision to call it quits was due to their differing stances on marriage and having kids: She wanted a family, but Cena, 41, was hesitant.\n\n\u201cThis was never really about ending their relationship \u2014 it was about calling off a wedding because something didn\u2019t feel right,\u201d an insider said. \u201cIt was a wedding that was entered into under false pretenses. She was pretending she was okay with not having a kid, he was pretending he absolutely couldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t budge on that point.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey both got a wake-up call once they canceled the wedding, and they both realized they could fix what was broken,\u201d the insider added.\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

She loves him, and she knows he loves her desperately,\u201d said the source. \u201cThey\u2019ll get back together and they\u2019ll get married the way they always should have: something small, intimate, for only the closest family and friends. Not some huge circus that will spook John or make him feel like he\u2019s a performing monkey \u2014 something that can be about just the two of them.\u201d\n\nAdded the source, \u201cThe wedding they called off no longer felt like their wedding \u2014 it was a wedding for TV, a wedding for publicity, a wedding for the fans and for viewers almost. That\u2019s what made them able to walk away from it \u2014 it didn\u2019t even feel like their day anymore, and it was already so tainted by the arguments and bad feelings that lead up to it and during the planning of it. In the end, calling it off is going to be the best thing that ever happened to their relationship.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/john-cena4.jpg?crop=0px%2C51px%2C1539px%2C808px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/john-cena4.jpg?crop=0px%2C51px%2C1539px%2C808px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Natalie Stone"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/nikki-bella-and-john-cena-officially-back-together/", "title": "Nikki Bella and John Cena Are Officially Back Together \u2014 Six Weeks After Calling Off Wedding", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Couples,John Cena,News,Nikki Bella,TV", "news_keywords": "Couples,John Cena,News,Nikki Bella,TV", "description": "\u201cThey were always going to find their way back to each other,\" a source tells PEOPLE", "og": {"title": "Nikki Bella and John Cena Are Officially Back Together \u2014 Six Weeks After Calling Off Wedding", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/nikki-bella-and-john-cena-officially-back-together/", "description": "\u201cThey were always going to find their way back to each other,\" a source tells PEOPLE", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/john-cena4.jpg?crop=0px%2C51px%2C1539px%2C808px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/nikki-bella-and-john-cena-officially-back-together/", "description": "\u201cThey were always going to find their way back to each other,\" a source tells PEOPLE", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/john-cena4.jpg?crop=0px%2C51px%2C1539px%2C808px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/nikki-bella-and-john-cena-officially-back-together/", "title": "Nikki Bella and John Cena Are Officially Back Together \u2014 Six Weeks After Calling Off Wedding", "description": "\u201cThey were always going to find their way back to each other,\" a source tells PEOPLE", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/john-cena4.jpg?crop=0px%2C51px%2C1539px%2C808px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
