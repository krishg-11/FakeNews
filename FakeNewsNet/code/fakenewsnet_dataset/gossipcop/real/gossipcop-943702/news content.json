Officers arrived shortly thereafter and made contact with the person complained of, Farrah Abraham,\u201d a spokesperson for the Beverly Hills Police Department tells PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cA male adult hotel security officer reported that he asked Abraham to leave the hotel after she refused to disengage from a verbal altercation with hotel guests,\u201d says the spokesperson. \u201cThe security officer reported that Abraham struck him in the face with her forearm, grabbed his ear and pushed him in the face as he attempted to prevent her from re-entering the hotel. Officers noted that Abraham exhibited signs of intoxication during the investigation.\u201d\n\nAccording to the spokesperson, the victim \u201csustained minor injury and was not transported to a hospital.\u201d\n\nAbraham was arrested for misdemeanor battery and trespassing pursuant to a private person\u2019s arrest.

Farrah is the hardest working individual I know and sets very high standards of herself.
