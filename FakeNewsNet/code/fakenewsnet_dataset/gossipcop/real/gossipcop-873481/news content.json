Intrigue reached fever pitch when Scott Peterson was arrested for double-murder and sent to death row after a long, captivating trial in 2004 that spawned made-for-TV movies, books and countless headlines and hours of cable commentary.\n\nThe ruckus then died down for several years, allowing Modesto time to heal out of the national limelight.\n\nUntil now.\n\nSubscribe and Save Act now to get a full year of unlimited digital access \u2013 just $49.99! VIEW OFFER\n\n\u201cTruth and Lies: The Murder of Laci Peterson,\u201d airing Thursday on ABC, is just the latest in a string of television specials about the compelling case \u2014 the sixth this year, with two more scheduled in the fall. A&E Network\u2019s \u201cThe Murder of Laci Peterson\u201c will air the finale to its seven-hour series on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s jumping on the crime bandwagon,\u201d said Beth Karas, who covered the Peterson trial for Court TV and now provides legal analysis in podcasts she produces..\n\nWhy the renewed interest?\n\nSome commentators note that Scott Peterson\u2019s appeals, several years in the making, are nearing resolution. The California Supreme Court could schedule hearings in coming months, and could decide in a year or so whether he deserves a new trial.\n\nOther observers say the resurgence might be timed to roughly coincide with the coming 15-year anniversary of Laci Peterson\u2019s disappearance, on Christmas Eve 2002.\n\nStill others credit \u2014 or blame \u2014 fierce competition among TV channels, ever hungry for viewers. And the Peterson saga, with elements of infidelity, deadly violence, innocent victims and enduring mystery, still has it all no matter how much time goes by.\n\n\u201cWhen one (outlet) finds there is an interest, it leads to others piggybacking on the same idea,\u201d mused Dr. Robi Ludwig, a psychotherapist and TV analyst..\n\nOther recent productions include a \u201cPrimetime Justice\u201d segment on HLN in August, a \u201cSnapped\u201d episode on Oxygen in May, \u201cDateline NBC\u201d in April and \u201cThe Dr. Oz Show\u201d in February. Look for more Peterson shows in the fall, from Investigation Discovery and from HLN, which is preparing an episode in its \u201cHow It Really Happened\u201d docuseries.\n\nSome shows, like \u201cDateline,\u201d seem geared to confirm Scott Peterson\u2019s guilt, and rely heavily on participation from the prosecution team and Laci\u2019s family. Her mother, Sharon Rocha, cooperated with ABC for the show premiering Thursday.\n\n\u201cI remember running around in the park and yelling her name, and there\u2019s nothing worse than lifting up a trash can looking for your child, to see if her body is in a trash can,\u201d Rocha said, according to an ABC release. \u201cWhen it\u2019s happening to somebody else, you think, \u2018That\u2019s a horrible thing to happen to those people.\u2019 And you think that you can imagine how they feel. You don\u2019t. You have no idea what it\u2019s like.\u201d\n\nOther shows, such as A&E\u2019s and Oxygen\u2019s, are asking the same question raised at the beginning of this article: What happened to Laci? They examine alternate theories for her demise, with cooperation from Scott Peterson\u2019s family and his celebrity attorney, Los Angeles\u2019 Mark Geragos.\n\nSome people connected to the case appear in several shows regardless of point of view, such as juror Mike Belmessieri.\n\n\u201cBy now, if people don\u2019t get it, why should I waste my time?\u201d he said, explaining why he\u2019s finally turning down interview requests. \u201cI try to make a point, and it\u2019s this: He\u2019s guilty. He is. There is no question in my mind.\u201d\n\nStacey Boyers-Birdsong, a friend of Laci\u2019s, said, \u201cAll of a sudden we\u2019re getting flooded with phone calls and requests (for interviews). After a while, what more is there to say? They know the story, and they ask the same questions. But if it\u2019s going to help Laci and Conner find justice, I have no problem talking. We\u2019ll fight to keep (Scott) where he is.\u201d\n\nLast weekend was emotion-packed for Boyers-Birdsong and other loved ones of Laci. Several participated in the newly revived Laci & Conner Memorial Ride for motorcyclists and other drivers on Saturday, then headed to the foothills on Sunday for an event raising awareness of people missing from Tuolumne County. Rocha, who founded a search and rescue fund to honor her daughter and grandson, attended last year; this year brought the likes of Marcia Clark, the famed prosecutor of O.J. Simpson, and Modesto\u2019s Susan Levy, mother of Chandra Levy, who was romantically linked to former Congressman Gary Condit and was murdered in Washington, D.C.\n\nTLC revisited the Levy case with a three-hour special just last week.\n\n\u201cTrue crime is definitely experiencing something of a renaissance right now,\u201d said Jean Murley, author of \u201cThe Rise of True Crime: 20th Century Murder and American Popular Culture.\u201d The genre lately has expanded to include low-profile but still interesting cases as people show more interest in the criminal justice system, she said.\n\nMurley and Karas noted the success of Netflix\u2019s \u201cMaking a Murderer,\u201d a 10-episode series which raised considerable doubt about whether Wisconsin\u2019s Steven Avery and his nephew were wrongly convicted for the murder of a woman.. Both also pointed to \u201cSerial,\u201d an acclaimed investigative journalism podcast.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for people to conceptualize somebody who is so good-looking, to think he\u2019s capable of a heinous crime. People grapple with that, and it contributes to increased curiosity,\u201d said Ludwig, who wrote \u201c\u2019Till Death Do Us Part: Love, Marriage, and the Mind of the Killer Spouse.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you accept that Scott Peterson is a heinous killer, a normal guy who decided to kill his wife and unborn child, then maybe you have to consider that the people in our lives may not be so normal either,\u201d she said.\n\nIt may be counterintuitive, but people are drawn to things that frighten them, said Catherine Pelonero, whose books focus on notorious crimes in New York.\n\n\u201cMost of us can relate to becoming very angry, but we wouldn\u2019t take that step of actually killing someone,\u201d she said. \u201cSo there is a natural fascination with those who do, with what it takes to push someone that far. It\u2019s really very primal in all of us.\u201d\n\nGarth Stapley: 209-578-2390", "images": ["https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/968074018/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://www.modbee.com/latest-news/9oah1u/picture171894972/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/lacimemorial", "https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/5502557044001/55ae56cf-1ae7-4e2b-b5b8-9551a4192b2f/c23f1335-ad27-4f33-91f2-400a57459db0/1280x720/match/image.jpg", "https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/5502557044001/55469675-f9fc-4ef5-9836-af28c991f039/8835c294-f734-4995-822c-bcbda797be34/1280x720/match/image.jpg", "https://www.modbee.com/wps/build/images/modbee/logo.svg", "https://www.modbee.com/wps/build/images/modbee/apple-touch-icon-57-precomposed.png", "https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/jit/5502557044001/c1a23bd1-d5a4-40a5-8676-3d0356284b93/main/1280x720/50s944ms/match/image.jpg", "https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/5502557044001/dc35bbfd-7c01-4db1-8948-b51d127b8766/6545aa03-782f-4b57-ad12-5476ffc38c2b/1280x720/match/image.jpg", "https://www.modbee.com/wps/build/images/mcclatchydc/logo-impact.svg", "https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/5502557044001/d74c5bd3-f80e-4251-bb8d-a6b5c7954274/b7f75b09-398e-4a0b-8dba-5c36093c29ef/1280x720/match/image.jpg", "https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/5502557044001/6bf9ec41-5a26-42fe-879a-a44c84e1407d/8c8bb755-9967-4214-83fb-34847a7fa957/1280x720/match/image.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/5502557044001/d74c5bd3-f80e-4251-bb8d-a6b5c7954274/b7f75b09-398e-4a0b-8dba-5c36093c29ef/1280x720/match/image.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.modbee.com/news/local/crime/scott-peterson-case/article173093346.html", "title": "Scott and Laci Peterson: The saga that TV won't let die | Modesto Bee", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "/wps/build/images/modbee/windowsmetro-144.png", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "modbee", "title": "Scott and Laci Peterson: The saga that TV won't let die", "description": "Renewed interest in the story of Scott and Laci Peterson results in several television channels revisiting Modesto's most notorious double-murder, a 15-year-old case that captivated people across the United States and beyond.", "image": "https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/5502557044001/d74c5bd3-f80e-4251-bb8d-a6b5c7954274/b7f75b09-398e-4a0b-8dba-5c36093c29ef/1280x720/match/image.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "modbee", "type": "article", "title": "Scott and Laci Peterson: The saga that TV won't let die", "url": "https://www.modbee.com/news/local/crime/scott-peterson-case/article173093346.html", "description": "Renewed interest in the story of Scott and Laci Peterson results in several television channels revisiting Modesto's most notorious double-murder, a 15-year-old case that captivated people across the United States and beyond.", "image": "https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/5502557044001/d74c5bd3-f80e-4251-bb8d-a6b5c7954274/b7f75b09-398e-4a0b-8dba-5c36093c29ef/1280x720/match/image.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 174393476082180, "pages": 8552722321}, "title": "Scott and Laci Peterson: The saga that TV won't let die | Modesto Bee", "allow-comments": "true", "description": "Renewed interest in the story of Scott and Laci Peterson results in several television channels revisiting Modesto's most notorious double-murder, a 15-year-old case that captivated people across the United States and beyond.", "keywords": "peterson, laci, scott, murder, modesto, tv, television, amber frey, sharon rocha", "news_keywords": "peterson, laci, scott, murder, modesto, tv, television, amber frey, sharon rocha", "googlebot": "noodp, noarchive", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "google-site-verification": "Y9AUrQRc1wvpJQpl6N75KZhTcCcJMYIWF_-VA5Xhv74", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=511925305, affiliate-data=at=1010lHsN&ct=SmartAppBannerMOD, app-argument=https://www.modbee.com/news/local/crime/scott-peterson-case/article173093346.html?appNav=smartBanner", "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"article_id\": \"173093346\"}"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.modbee.com", "summary": ""}
