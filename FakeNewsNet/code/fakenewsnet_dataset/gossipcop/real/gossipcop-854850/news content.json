Perry was even asked by Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show Friday whether this song, off her upcoming Witness album, was about \u201canyone we know.\u201d While the pop diva remained cryptic, she explained the meaning of \u201cSwish Swish\u201d is \u201cliberation\u201d from bullies.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a great anthem for people to use whenever someone\u2019s trying to hold you down or bully you,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of what this record is about, it\u2019s just like [a] 360-degree liberation.\u201d If \u201cChained to the Rhythm\u201d was about \u201cpolitical liberation\u201d and \u201cBon App\u00e9tit\u201d was a \u201csexual liberation,\u201d then Perry calls \u201cSwish Swish\u201d \u201cthe liberation from all the negative that doesn\u2019t serve you.\u201d\n\nPerry directed her fans to the segment on social media Saturday morning. \u201cHere\u2019s some of the tea and a biscuit,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nMorning! Here's some of the tea and a biscuit \u2615\ufe0fhttps://t.co/7I50PYq66Z \u2014 KATY PERRY (@katyperry) May 20, 2017\n\nSince \u201cSwish Swish\u201d dropped on Thursday, listeners, including Swift pal Ruby Rose, pointed to the lyrics as a diss track. \u201cI\u2019ve always stood up for the people I love and against things I think are cheap or mean spirited. That\u2019s not new. You have to follow your [heart emoji],\u201d Rose wrote in a series of tweets.\n\nRELATED: Celebrity Feuds: A look at famous Hollywood fights\n\nPerry and Swift have reportedly been feuding since an alleged spat over backup dancers a couple of years ago. Swift\u2019s 1989 hit \u201cBad Blood\u201d has long been rumored to be a strike against Perry, and when asked by Entertainment Weekly if Witness included a response to the Swift song, Perry said it was \u201cnot my question to answer \u2014 if it\u2019s about me.\u201d\n\nShe further explained, \u201cI think [my new album is] a very empowered record. There is no one thing that\u2019s calling out any one person. One thing to note is: You can\u2019t mistake kindness for weakness and don\u2019t come for me. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone. And that\u2019s not to any one person and don\u2019t quote me that it is, because it\u2019s not. It\u2019s not about that.\u201d\n\nWatch her latest explanation of \u201cSwish Swish\u201d on The Tonight Show above.", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/nup_178482_0684.jpg?crop=195px%2C74px%2C2149px%2C1128px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2a147acd56f71c458ad74777cefaea83?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/nup_178482_0684.jpg?crop=195px%2C74px%2C2149px%2C1128px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nick Romano"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/05/20/katy-perry-swish-swish-meaning-jimmy-fallon/", "title": "Katy Perry explains meaning of 'Swish Swish,' calls it 'great anthem'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Katy Perry, Swish Swish, Witness, Jimmy Fallon, Tonight Show, Taylor Swift, Nicki Minaj", "news_keywords": "Katy Perry, Swish Swish, Witness, Jimmy Fallon, Tonight Show, Taylor Swift, Nicki Minaj", "description": "But is it about Taylor Swift?", "og": {"title": "Katy Perry Explains Meaning of \"Swish Swish,\" Calls It \"Great Anthem\"", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/05/20/katy-perry-swish-swish-meaning-jimmy-fallon/", "description": "But ... is it about Taylor Swift?", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/nup_178482_0684.jpg?crop=195px%2C74px%2C2149px%2C1128px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/05/20/katy-perry-swish-swish-meaning-jimmy-fallon/", "description": "But is it about Taylor Swift?", "media": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/nup_178482_0684.jpg?crop=195px%2C74px%2C2149px%2C1128px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/05/20/katy-perry-swish-swish-meaning-jimmy-fallon/", "title": "Katy Perry Explains Meaning of \"Swish Swish,\" Calls It \"Great Anthem\"", "description": "But is it about Taylor Swift?", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/nup_178482_0684.jpg?crop=195px%2C74px%2C2149px%2C1128px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1495252800.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
