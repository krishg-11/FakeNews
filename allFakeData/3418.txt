Jennifer Lawrence Moves on from Darren Aronofsky — Who’s Her New Man?

Actress Jennifer Lawrence has a new beau!

Lawrence, 27, has been spotted in New York with art gallerist Cooke Maroney, 33. A source told Page Six, “They met through Jen’s friend Laura… The relationship has been going on a few weeks. But they have been very private and careful not to be seen together.”

The romance news comes just a week after Jennifer reunited with Darren at the BAM Gala, where she presented him with an award.

Aside from Darren, Jennifer has dated Chris Martin and Nicholas Hoult.

John Mayer recently joked about how bummed he was that Jennifer won’t date him, telling Andy Cohen, “You’re friends with Jennifer Lawrence, who just, she doesn’t wanna have anything to do with me. I don’t have the greatest track record when it comes to celebrity relationships.”
