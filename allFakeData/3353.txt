The pictures that have fans convinced Katie Holmes is pregnant

The 38-year-old actress has been linked to actor Jamie Foxx since 2013, and they were most recently spotted on Malibu beach, laughing and frolicking around.

Life & Style most recently reported that Katie is pushing for their relationship to become public, with a source telling the publication, 'Jamie has been a big part of their life for a while now and aside from the occasional walk on the beach, the pair have kept their private life private.'

While attending an event in New York City this morning, Katie sparked baby rumours by covering up with a large coat, and when it was spotted open a small bump was visible.
