Kate Hudson Net Worth

Kate Hudson Net Worth and salary: Kate Hudson is an American actress, producer and entrepreneur who has a net worth of $80 million dollars. She was born Kate Garry Hudson on April 19, 1979, in Los Angeles, California. Kate came to prominence thanks to the 2001 film "Almost Famous". This role not only made her famous, but it also fetched her a Golden Globe and several other major nominations, including a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She is the daughter of actress Goldie Hawn and bears more than a passing resemblance to her famous mother. One of Kate's earliest roles came in 1996, when she made her TV debut on the Fox TV series Party of Five (1994-2000). Although she only appeared in one episode titled "Spring Breaks: Part 1", this initial experience was enough to uphold her determination to develop a professional acting career of her own. However, it wasn't until 1999 that she started to attract public attention when critics lauded her brilliant portrayal of Cindy in "200 Cigarettes", even though the movie itself was a commercial disappointment. She received acclaim for supporting roles in "Gossip" and "Dr T and the Women" which both were released in 2000. As we mentioned previously, it was her performance in Cameron Crowe's "Almost Famous" that proved she was set to follow her mother's footsteps in taking the film industry by storm. In the midst of a whirlwind schedule of fashion shoots and awards shows, she made an appearance in the romantic war drama "The Four Feathers", in 2002. Turning out to be a box-office failure, Hudson fired back with the surefire hit as she starred opposite quirky heartthrob Matthew McConaughey in the romantic comedy "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days" in 2003. She continued to establish herself as a highly sought-after actress starring in subsequent productions like Raising Helen (2004), The Skeleton Key (2005), You, Me and Dupree (2006), Fool's Gold (2008), Bride Wars (2009), The Killer Inside Me (2010), Wish I Was Here (2014), Mother's Day (2016) and more.

Fabletics: In July 2013, Kate and two partners founded a subscription athleisure company called Fabletics. Over time the company would eventually grow from being primarily e-commerce based, to operating 22 retail stores. They also operate a menswear line under the label FL2. According to a 2017 Forbes article, the company was at one point valued at $250 million. It's believed that Kate owns 20% of the company as of November 2018. Assuming the $250 million valuation has held, Kate's pre-tax stake would be worth $50 million.
