HRC Caught On Tape Laughing About Irma Wiping Out All Of Those Florida Hillbillies

Hillary Caught On Tape Laughing About Irma Wiping Out All Of Those Florida HillbilliesWhile filming a segment for The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC, Hillary Rodham Clinton was nabbed on tape saying the most awful thing imaginable about Hurricane Irma and its potential victims:TO BE HONEST, RACHEL, IT WOULD PROBABLY BE GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY IF IRMA WERE TO JUST WIPE EVERY FLORIDA HILLBILLY OFF THE MAP. I MEAN THEY LIVE IN TRAILERS BY THE WATER, RIGHT?Clinton began to laugh but Maddow stopped her:MADAM SECRETARY, THATS NOT FUNNY. THERE ARE 37 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE PATH OF THE WORST STORM OUR COUNTRY HAS SEEN SINCE KATRINA AND IT WILL PROBABLY DO MORE DAMAGE. THAT WAS CALLOUS AND WRONG. YOUVE BEEN POISONED. NOT EVERYTHING IS POLITICS.Maddow cancelled the interview and agreed to bury the footage, but one sound engineer who is a true patriot managed to keep a copy:AS SOON AS I HEARD HER SAY IT I KNEW SHE SCREWED UP REAL BAD. SHE WAS TALKING TO PEOPLE BACKSTAGE ABOUT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AGAIN IN 2020. THERE AINT NO WAY SHES GONNA RUN NOW. NOT WITHOUT MAKING ME A VERY RICH MAN.The engineer, who refused to be named, says he will hold onto the footage until he needs it to either save the country or himself. He says hes made arrangements in case anything happens to him.Read More; Hillary Caught On Tape Laughing About Irma âWiping Out All Of Those Florida Hillbilliesâ - Patriots Voice My Thoughts:Wouldnt surprise me, there was a video of her when Bill was governor talking about kids with handicap problems at an Easter egg hunt at the governors living quarters going too slow and she said, Get these retards out of here.
