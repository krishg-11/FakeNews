Angelina Jolie has her eyes set on British actor Ed Skrein

The 42-year-old actress is said to have ‘hand-picked’ hot British actor Ed Skrein, 35, to star alongside her in Maleficent 2.

‘Ange chose Ed because he’s young and gorgeous and has a perfect physique,’ tattles a source to Star.

However, Ange may be left disappointed, as the self-confessed ‘family man’ – he shares a seven-year-old son with his long-term girlfriend – has revealed he’s not really into hanging out with castmates.

‘I just go back to the hotel room. I’m the most boring person,’ he says.
