Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Want Babies “Right Away”

Reports say "she’ll start trying as soon as she can."

The Royal Wedding was just a few weeks ago, but sources are buzzing that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle want children with the quickness.

“She and Harry want to start a family right away — and she’ll start trying as soon as she can," a source told US Weekly.

The source added that the timing is important: “Harry and Meghan won’t rush into anything. They have a lot on their plate right now. But they both think that when the moment feels right, that will be the time to go for it.”

How long should they wait to have kids? Experts say factors to evaluate before having children include their ages and the stability of the reationship. With the happy couple being in their mid-Thirties, science suggests they should get going now, as they seem to be doing.

Some people even think they were already pregnant at the Royal Wedding.

"I'm predicting she's pregnant and that explains the lack of the fitted waist on both gowns," Dina Manzo captioned a picture of Meghan in her wedding dress. The Real Housewives of New Jersey alum may not have the most popular opinion, but time will tell.
