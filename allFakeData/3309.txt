Are Selena Gomez & The Weeknd Working On A Movie Together?

Selena Gomez and The Weeknd are NOT working on a movie together, despite a new report. Gossip Cop can debunk this claim. We’re told it’s “not true.”

According to HollywoodLife, “things are about to get even hotter” between the stars, who hope to “share the screen” with one another. A so-called “source” tells the outlet, “Working on music would be great because they share that passion, but The Weeknd wants to get a little more into some film projects and would love to share the screen with Selena.” “But first before any of that is to have a successful relationship,” further contends the site’s dubious insider, adding, “and if working a lot with each other ruined that he would stop the extra stuff immediately to make the relationship flourish.”
