Brad and Jen's secret sleepovers

Despite Brad breaking Jen's heart in 2005 when he ended their five year marriage and seven year relationship to date Mr and Mrs Smith co-star Angelina Jolie, the former flames have decided to give it another go.

A source told In Touch, 'Brad and Jen are spending more and more time together.

'Those close to the pair wouldn't be surprised if they even had secret sleepovers.'

According to In Touch's explosive report, Brad has been helping Jen come to terms with her failed marriage. The publication reports that throughout the last year, Jen and Justin were spending an increasing amount of time apart.

'Justin was finding more reasons to be apart from his wife,' a source close to Jen spills. 'In addition to hating Hollywood, he couldn't stand her friends.'

A source even explosively reveals to In Touch that Jen 'turned up' at Brad's house.

'One day, Jen showed up at his door while Justin was out of town and they were having problems,' the source reveals to the publication. 'Brad sat her right down and provided the counsel that she needed.'

'He was very no-nonsense and really helped Jen come to terms with ending it with Justin,' added the source.

In Touch's bombshell report adds that since the breakdown of her marriage, Jen has been relying on Brad to be her rock.

A friend told the magazine, 'What's surprising about her separation from Justin is that one of her greatest supporters is her first husband.'

They add, 'He has been a true champion for Jen.'

Neither Jen or Brad have responded to In Touch's report.
