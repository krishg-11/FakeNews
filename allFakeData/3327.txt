Was NeNe Leakes Turned Down As A Weight-Loss Spokesperson? - The Real Housewives

NeNe Leakes may be a “very rich b–ch” but she’s always looking for ways to get richer.

However, it turns out that the Real Housewives of Atlanta star‘s latest get-rich-quick plan isn’t panning out so far.

According to Life & Style, NeNe is trying to get paid to endorse a major weight-loss product but isn’t getting any bites from companies.

“NeNe’s put on a few extra pounds,” says a source, “so she’s been reaching out to companies in hopes of getting a deal like Oprah Winfrey has with Weight Watchers, or Marie Osmond has with Nutrisystem.”

But it seems that companies aren’t interested.

Why do you ask?

NeNe “is a hothead,” sources say. “No big company wants to gamble that she can keep her attitude at bay.”

Adding that, “she sticks her foot in her mouth way too much.”

A perfect example of NeNe’s hotheaded ways is the not so funny rape joke she made during a stand-up show a few months back.

I think NeNe would be a good spokesperson on a good day, but then again she has a nasty side she can’t always keep in check. Good PR is everything, and NeNe’s antics don’t always make that easy.

Thoughts on this rumor? Do you think NeNe is a hothead? Does NeNe need to change her ways to keep growing her fortune?
