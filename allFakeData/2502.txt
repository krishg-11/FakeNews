Allison Williams may play the unlucky in love character Marnie on HBO's Girls, but it appears that in real life she couldn't be happier. It was announced last week that Williams was set to wed her boyfriend, Ricky Van Veen, and now we've gotten a closer look at her dazzling engagement ring! The actress flashed her diamond sparkler for the first time at Sunday's Vanity Fair Oscar party, making for a major red carpet moment.

Williams' cushion-cut ring is seriously stunning—and massive—and appears to be flanked by multiple diamonds on each side. The classic rock suits her pretty style, and we think Van Veen made the perfect choice. The actress met her fiancé, who co-founded CollegeHumor, through mutual friends, and the pair have been together for three years. Given our love for her style, we can’t wait to see what the star will choose to wear when she walks down the aisle.
