Did Ellen & Portia have a food fight at a restaurant?

Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi have been favorite tabloid fodder lately, with rumors that the couple is no longer happy and headed for a breakup. Now the gossip mags are having a field day over reports that DeGeneres and de Rossi had a food fight in a restaurant.

British tabloid OK! Magazine reported the breakup rumors in the wake of the couple selling their $45 million dollar Santa Barbara home and $7 million condo in Beverly Hills.

Gossip Cop is debunking the claims of a fight over food, reporting that the National Enquirer is claiming the couple blew up at one another because de Rossi only ordered soup. It argues that DeGeneres carefully watches everything she eats. The report has been picked up by Radar Online as well.

Gossip Cop calls bunk on that claim:

An actual DeGeneres confidante assures us the entire report is “false.” The talk show host did not get into a fight with de Rossi over food. The Enquirer cooked up this fabricated dish.

DeGeneres disputed rumors that she and de Rossi were breaking up in October, saying they couldn’t be further from the truth, that she can’t imagine not being married ,and calling her wife her best friend.
