Selena Gomez & Justin Bieber Relationship Timeline 2009-2018

April 2019: Justin Reveals He Doesn't Follow Selena on Instagram

Justin recently took to Instagram to call out an account that was bullying him online, but in the process he revealed something very interesting about his relationship with his ex.

As you can see in the pic, Justin isn't following Selena on Insta. And poor Biebs can't avoid his ex, as even Instagram is suggesting they reconcile.

Justin hasn't actually followed Selena for a while. Even when the two rekindled their romance back in 2017/2018, they didn't follow each other. But this serves as an interesting reminder that Jelena is truly over (I will never be done mourning it). Of course, while the two singers don't follow each other, they both have public accounts, so who's to say if they don't continue to Insta-stalk each other? I wouldn't blame them.
