Why Meghan Markle ‘TAMED’ Prince Harry more than Cressida and Chelsy ever could

Meghan Markle, 36, will marry Prince Harry, 33, in a royal wedding ceremony on May 19 2018, and it seems the royal’s wife-to-be stands out from his previous girlfriends in one particular way.

It is known Prince Harry had high profile relationships with Chelsy Davy, 32, and Cressida Bonas, 29, before he began dating Meghan in 2016.

However, a royal expert has said no previous romantic interest had ever “tamed” Harry in the way that Meghan has done.

“I think Meghan has had a really positive influence on Harry,” Katie Nicholl, author of Harry Life Loss and Love told Express.co.uk exclusively.

“Historically Harry has always been ‘tamed’ by his girlfriends, we saw that with Chelsy and Cressida, but I think Meghan’s had a bigger influence on him than any other woman.”
