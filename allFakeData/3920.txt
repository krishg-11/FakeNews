2000: The Singing Debate

In an interview with Peter Travers, Clooney finally addressed something fans had been wondering for quite some time: Did he actually sing in O Brother, Where Art Thou? Since his aunt, the famed Rosemary Clooney, had such a stellar singing career, the producers assumed he, too, would have a solid set of pipes.



"Then we got into the recording studio and I sang 'Man of Constant Sorrow' with all the music playing, and I finished and looked up and there's that glass booth with all of them in it and no one would look me in the eye," he told Travers.



As it turns out, the rumor that Clooney did not sing for this film was totally true. "They played it back and it was pretty bad. It was so bad that I made them destroy it."
