How Much Alec Baldwin Makes Per Episode For Portraying Trump On SNL

Alec Baldwin's Donald Trump portrayal has certainly been popular with some factions and not with others, but it's safe to say that is should live on as an example of a classic Saturday Night Live character for some time to come. So, even though Alec Baldwin is only making $1,400 bucks to show up to practice and plan for each new Trump-based sketch, plus to perform during that inconvenient late night airing on Saturday night, he's certainly earning brownie points in other places. We're still talking about Tina Fey's Sarah Palin impression years and years later. Anticipate the same thing will happen for Alec Baldwin and Trump--especially if he continues the impression during the duration of Donald Trump's new gig.
