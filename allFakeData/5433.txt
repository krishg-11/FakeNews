Warm welcome? It was reported she confronted the blonde about whether she was having an affair with her husband away back in 2015

Meanwhile, People previously reported Jennifer, 45, confronted the 37-year-old blonde about whether she was having an affair with her husband way back in 2015.

When the initial split was announced in 2015, it was alleged the Batman V Superman star 'had an affair with the pair's former nanny'.

In addition, multiple sources claimed Ben and Lindsay started having an affair all the way back in 2013, two years before he had separated from his wife.

Lindsay was also married at the time to SNL producer Kevin Miller, who sired her four-year-old daughter Madeline, however they split up in 2014.

That was also a memorable year for Ben, as he demanded the fact an ancestor had been a slave owner be omitted from his appearance on PBS genealogy series Finding Your Roots, a fact that emerged during the Sony email hacking scandal.

Jennifer has remained single, focusing on her children since her split from her husband of 10 years in June 2015.
