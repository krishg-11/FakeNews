Is Rihanna Really Pregnant?: Leonardo DiCaprio or Drake the Father?





There are reports that Rihanna is pregnant with her first child, which leads us to ask if actor Leonardo DiCaprio is the father...or Rihanna's ex, Drake?

MTO claims they have had contact with a member of Rihanna's camp that has revealed Rihanna has stopped drinking, stopped smoking weed, and is not smoking cigarettes. Maybe she is just trying to be healthier?

The site also claims that a close friend of RiRi's said the singer did not even smoke marijuana on 4/20 and does not want any weed smoked around her.

MediaTakeout.com also notes that Rihanna's belly is a little poochy, wondering if she has a small baby bump.









If Rihanna is indeed pregnant, would the father more likely be rapper Drake or Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio. She has been rumored to be seen with both men on occasion in the past month.









They report that Rihanna is not pregnant, debunking another Rihanna pregnant story posted by MTO.

Gossip Cop claims MTO is completely full of it, even calling them a "disreputable webloid."
