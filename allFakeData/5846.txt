Leonardo DiCaprio and blond model Nina Agdal have called it quits.

Sources tell Page Six that the Oscar winner and Victoria’s Secret model broke up earlier this week, after dating for nearly a year.

But the breakup is amicable. “They split up early this week and they remain friends,” said a pal close to the couple. A source added that the relationship “ran its course.”

They were together in late March for her 25th birthday on a yacht in St. Bart’s with pals, including Orlando Bloom.

But last Tuesday, the couple was seen at West Hollywood sushi restaurant Itacho, sources tell Page Six, where it seemed that the thrill was gone. Witnesses said that PDA was “minimal.”

But Agdal doesn’t seem too broken up about the split, posting a provocative bikini shot on Wednesday with the caption, “Rooftop season ready.”

Meanwhile, DiCaprio, 42, was seen Saturday in Malibu with friends.

DiCaprio and Agdal were first spotted together in May 2016 at a club, then in June on a weekend getaway in Montauk. They were later seen around the globe at various hot spots, but the pair never officially confirmed they were a couple.

Before dating Agdal, DiCaprio split with another blonde, Sports Illustrated babe Kelly Rohrbach, and has been linked to a litany of leggy catwalkers like Gisele Bündchen, Bar Refaeli, Erin Heatherton and Toni Garrn.
