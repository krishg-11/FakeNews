Kim & Kanye: It's over

This week, Kanye West has caused controversy across the globe thanks to his erratic and bizarre Tweets - including supporting US President Donald Trump and claims that slavery was a 'choice.'

The 40-year-old rapper called himself the 'future president', bragged about his 'dragon energy' and announced he had fired his management because he 'can't be managed.' Wife Kim Kardashian was quick to jump to his defense, tweeting to her fans it was unfair to label her husband 'mentally ill' because he has always been 'expressive.'

In 2016, Kanye spent time in a psychiatric facility due to a mental breakdown.

Now, Life & Style has explosively claimed today that the rapper's problems are more serious than ever, with insiders claiming they've led to the disintegration of his four year marriage.

'Kim is in talks with lawyers about getting a divorce,' a friend close to Kim told Life & Style. 'Kanye's acting more unpredictable than ever. Things have gotten so bad that Kim and Kanye sleep in separate rooms.'
