OK! Exclusive: Kim Kardashian Is In Love With Her Life Guru

Kim Kardashian’s relationship with Kanye West has been rocky ever since she was robbed in Paris and after Kanye suffered a mental breakdown. It seems that Kim found refuge in another man, the famous life guru, Tony Robbins. OK! has exclusively learned that Kim dragged Kanye to one of Tony’s motivational speeches, only to ignore him and focus on the guru himself.

An insider dished to OK! that “Kim’s a life-long fan of Tony. She’s read all his books and watched all his motivational videos, but nothing could prepare her for the man in person.”

“Kim’s had such a mad crush on Tony for so long she actually started welling up in tears,” the source added.

Apparently Kanye did not like the situation at all. “Kanye was so embarrassed and pissed about it – he’s never seen her like this,” continued the source.

It looks Kanye’s huge ego is in trouble because of Tony. “She was like a star-struck Beatles fan. Kim thinks Tony’s ‘God’ and literally hung off every word. She’s crazy about him!”
