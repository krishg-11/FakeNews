Jennifer Lopez Reflects on Past Relationship With Ben Affleck: "There Was a Genuine Love"

Lopez and Affleck called off their engagement in early 2004, just before their wedding. Weeks later, Lopez reunited with ex Marc Anthony and the two wed after several months and later welcomed twins, Max and Emme, who are now 8. Lopez and Anthony split in 2011. That year, she started dating backup dancer Casper Smart, 28.

Affleck went on to date his Daredevil co-star Jennifer Garner. The two wed in 2005 and had three children, Violet, 10, Seraphina, 7 and Samuel, 4. The couple announced last June they planned to divorce. No papers have been filed.

In 2014, Lopez said on the Today show her and Affleck's split was probably her "first big heartbreak." In 2015, she told HuffPost Live she had "no regrets" about her time with the actor. A month after she spoke to HuffPost Live, Lopez and Affleck reunited briefly at the Oscars.

"I would do it all over again, I think. I really would. Even the relationship part," she told the outlet. "I just feel like everything is part of your story and your journey and is meant to be and helps you grow if you're willing to look at it, and I'm willing to look."

Affleck told The Hollywood Reporter in 2012 he keeps in touch Lopez, as well as other ex-girlfriend Gwyneth Paltrow and his high school sweetheart, Cheyenne Rothman.

"We don't have the kind of relationship where she relies on me for advice," he said about Lopez, "but we do have the kind of relationship where there'll be an e-mail saying, 'Oh, your movie looks great.' I remember when she got American Idol. I said, 'This was really smart. Good luck.'"

"I touch base," he said. "I respect her. I like her. She's put up with some stuff that was unfair in her life, and I'm really pleased to see her successful."
