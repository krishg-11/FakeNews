Jamie Foxx & Katie Holmes Are Still Together Despite Breakup Rumors

Despite reports of Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes calling it quits on a relationship that some have dated as far back as five years ago, Katie Holmes’ publicist and other sources have confirmed that the stories are not at all true.

“The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, a rep for the actress said.

According to Page Six, the false report broke around the time that Foxx was in Atlantic City for the opening of the new Ocean Resort Casino and was filming with Mark Wahlberg the night before for his “Wahlburgers” television show.

“Jamie was telling friends he’s expecting his girlfriend Katie Holmes to join him in Atlantic City,” the source tells the publication, adding that, “Katie’s daughter, Suri, wouldn’t be coming down — because she was in summer camp.”

This contradicted Radar Online's report Wednesday about Katie calling Jamie over the phone because she “couldn’t get over her trust issues.” Radar Online would add that there was “no drama . . . just sadness when Katie called up Jamie to tell him she couldn’t do this anymore.”

Sources also say that while Foxx was at the new casino’s opening, he was at the head of a conga line of nearly 1,000 people and was directing the DJ to alternate between Prince and Michael Jackson songs. According to them, Jamie reportedly footed a bill for 100 bottles of Dom Perignon champagne. On his usual antics, the comedian, actor, and singer even got down on one knee and proposed to a 93-year old patron in the building.

“This is what it’s all about, loving everybody,” Foxx said to the sea of people.
