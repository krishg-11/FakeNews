Katie Holmes Sparks Engagement Rumors With Diamond Ring

Is she or isn't she? Katie Holmes is sparking rumors that she might be engaged after stepping out in New Orleans wearing a massive diamond ring on her left hand. And while the bling is very telling, it sounds like the actress, 39, may not be ready for that next step just yet.

Holmes, who is currently filming upcoming movie The Secret, was apparently only wearing the rock for the flick. A rep for Holmes told People the ring is not an engagement ring.

“Katie’s not engaged to anyone besides her fictional movie fiancé, played by Jerry O’Connell,” her rep said.

It's not surprising that fans were speculating about her relationship status: Holmes has been dating actor Jamie Foxx since August 2013, just one year after her split from Tom Cruise. Though Foxx and Holmes have kept their relationship largely private, the two have been photographed together more and more in the past year.

In May, a source told People that the couple are still cautious about being seen together.

“Everyone knows they are dating, but they still want to keep it private,” the insider said. “After the beach pictures, they only spent time together at home and got extra careful. But this year, they have been more social together. They often go to restaurants for dinner dates, or to hang out with friends.”
