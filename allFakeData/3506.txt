I'm an L Chat addict ;)I think most of it is in that thread - almost no heterosexual dating history despite being almost 40 (we only have her word that there was ever any at all), she has a "gal pal" that she seems to travel with, she was very happy when same-sex marriage came through in the US, she's a feminist, she seems to be dating someone right now but hasn't put a name to whoever it is.....I have no reason to think she's close to coming out but I figure that you never know.
