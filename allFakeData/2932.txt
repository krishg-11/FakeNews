Angelina Jolie & Brad Pitt Kicked Off Valentine’s Day With Kids, But Then She Ditched Them!

Angelina Jolie & Brad Pitt Kicked Off Valentine’s Day With Kids, But Then She Ditched Them!

Uh, we think she might have forgotten the most important thing for a Valentine├óΓé¼Γäós Day date…

…her date!

Angelina Jolie was just making sure she had enough Valentine’s Day love to go around as she made time for everyone, even if that meant ditching her hunny, Brad Pitt.

But don’t worry, the beauty was all about family as she began the romantic day with Brad and their twins, Vivienne and Knox, at the Natural History Museum in El Lay.

And boy, does it sound adorbz as a source revealed:

“Brad and Angelina stood back at one point and let the kids play. They were smiling and really enjoying the day — you can tell they love watching their kids learn.”

However, Angelina had to spread the love to her ladiez.

(Whoa! We’re sure Brad would have loved to join in on that. LOLz!)

The future Mrs. Pitt got a break from her brood as she stepped out for a VDay lunch at Public at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel with four other women and a man.

It sounds like Brad├óΓé¼Γäós VDay gift to her – other than those HIGHlarious mints – might have been an adult-only lunch where she didn├óΓé¼Γäót have to cut food up for the kids or wipe their mouths off. A source revealed:

├óΓé¼┼ô[She] seemed really comfortable and totally peaceful. Just having a nice lunch.├óΓé¼┬¥

Awww!

Luckily, Brad got his love back in time for dinner, which we’re guessing was pretty romantic, loving and damn hot.

How could it not be if you├óΓé¼Γäóre celebrating Valentine├óΓé¼Γäós Day with Brad Pitt?!
