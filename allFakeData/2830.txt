The 7 signs that David Beckham is definitely having a midlife crisis

For the uninitiated a midlife crisis is roughly defined as a transition of identity as you reach those awkward middle aged years. This period comes a close second in the awkwardness scale to adolescence - which, as you will all know, is very uncomfortable.

The midlife crisis can be clearly seen in former footballer and now semi-retired celebrity David Beckham, who appears to be tapping into his teenage spirit, growing his hair out and looking increasingly like Kurt Cobain.

It's all come to a head this week when Beckham posted pictures on Instagram of him indulging his childish fantasies by taking six days off to build a 4,000 piece Lego castle for his six year old daughter Harper.
