Is Kristen Stewart Replacing Angelina Jolie?

It's too early to tell if the film is even gonna happen, but it's not looking good for A.

Our insider says Kristen was approached to fill Jolie's hot-woman void in the franchise and met at least once with Timur Bekmambetov, the director of the series.

However, Angelina's participation in the project is still up in the air.

While her character died in the first installment of the film, Bekmambetov told MTV that he would bring her back in some capacity, in the sequel.

Only problem is A.J. reportedly backed out of the film. We hear details (aka money and exactly how much time she'd need to give to the flick) were never worked out, which is why Angelina is out, for now—but she could possibly make a cameo if the film actually happens.

So can Kristen save the franchise?

Our dishy source says the Stewart-McAvoy version of the project might not come to fruition, but it remains a slim possibility—and wouldn't it be damn hot! (Sure would be a lot happier news than that horrible fake car accident stuff which had K.Stew fans in a tizzy yesterday.)

Kristen is set to start filming Breaking Dawn possibly as early as October, while the Wanted follow-up was originally slated to start shooting around the end of August.

No production date has been set in stone for the final Twilight flick(s), which is making it difficult, we're told, for many of the actors involved in the vampire franchise to figure out their schedule allowed for outside projects. Anyone remember Rachelle Lefevre?

Be careful before you sign up for other projects, dearies!

Neither Bekmambetov nor a rep for Stewart responded to E!'s request for comment. While no offer was officially given to Kristen, word is that Bekmambetov is—for now—looking at other projects for the fall, given the scheduling conflicts.

Bummer! Nobody kicks ass like K.Stew.
