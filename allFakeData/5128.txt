Kris Jenner, Corey Gamble split: Reality star ‘needed space’

KARDASHIAN matriarch Kris Jenner has reportedly dumped her toy boy Corey Gamble, after two years of dating.

According to Radar Online, the 61-year-old told her 36-year-old boyfriend she needed some time out to focus on her family and their brand.

“Kris told Corey that she needed some space so that she could focus on her family and the show right now,” a source close to the Kardashians revealed to the media outlet.

“She said that she was getting sidetracked with this relationship and that she needed to put her family before her own needs and wants.”

Kris began dating Corey in November 2014, after splitting with her husband of 24 years, Bruce Jenner (now Caitlyn Jenner.)

The news comes amid dwindling ratings for Keeping Up With The Kardashians, with the current season attracting the lowest audience numbers yet.

“Kris just really wants to focus on the show right now to ensure that her family stays on air,” the source said.

“A lot of people in her inner circle think that Corey was nothing but a rebound from Caitlyn anyway.”

The reality TV mum certainly has enough going on to keep her mind off the split: TMZ is reporting Kris has been shopping around a new Kardashian cartoon series, along with yet another reality show option for her son Rob.
