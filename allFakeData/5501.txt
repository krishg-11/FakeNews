Sage Steele slammed for Instagram post about protests at airport

Sage Steele, like many sports figures, found herself in the middle of the debate over Donald Trumpâ€™s new immigration policy over the weekend â€” and received a lot of backlash for her comments about the protests at airports.

From her Instagram post:

So THIS is why thousands of us dragged luggage nearly 2 miles to get to LAX, but still missed our flights. Fortunately, a 7 hour wait for the next flight to Houston wonâ€™t affect me that much, but my heart sank for the elderly and parents with small children who did their best to walk all that way but had no chance of making their flights. I love witnessing people exercise their right to protest! But it saddened me to see the joy on their faces knowing that they were successful in disrupting so many peopleâ€™s travel plans. Yes, immigrants were affected by this as well. Brilliant. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

On Instagram, in an effort to stand up for the immigrants and refugees affected by the ban, many commentors criticized her for what they believed wasnâ€™t seeing the bigger picture. Many also resorted to using slurs to describe the ESPN personality, which is really just a reminder that social media can be terrible all around.

Steele defended herself â€” and her post â€” on Twitter:

@MikeSilver better, more effective ways to do it, Silver! Re-read my post. Don't worry â€” we can arm wrestle over it this week in Houston â€” Sage Steele (@sagesteele) January 30, 2017

@MikeSilver all goodâ€¦not the first time we disagree! :) but the crazy thing is, we can talk about it like adults & agree to disagree! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ â€” Sage Steele (@sagesteele) January 30, 2017
