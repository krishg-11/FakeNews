US report: ‘Pregnant Kate Hudson dumped in delivery room’

A sensational US report has today claimed that Kate Hudson has been 'dumped' by musician boyfriend Danny Fujikawa just days before she is due to give birth.

An insider allegedly told Star magazine that Kate, 39, was struck with a sudden sickness and rushed to hospital weeks before she was due to give birth to her first daughter, with the publication bizarrely claiming that Danny, 32, 'used Kate's health scar to end their relationship.'

'Danny told her he couldn't do this anymore,' the source outrageously alleged. 'Kate was devastated.'

Hudson is already mother to sons Ryder, 14, and Bingham, 7, with rocker ex Chris Robinson and Matthew Bellamy.
