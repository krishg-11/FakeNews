‘My trousers are too tight!’ Prince William’s shock confession to Prince Harry

Harry, 33, received loud cheers and a rapturous applause from the thousands of people outside St George’s Chapel in Windsor in the run up to his vows to Meghan.

The Prince was in relaxed mood as he said "I’m alright" in a heartwarming exchange with his 35-year-old brother as they entered the church, who joked "my trousers are too tight" as he complained that his military uniform wasn’t the ideal fit.

Both Princes are wearing black and gold uniforms of the Blues and Royals, similar to Harry’s outfit for William’s wedding to Kate Middleton in 2011.

The uniforms are tailored at Dege & Skinner on Saville Row, and they also received permission from the Queen to wear their Army uniforms to the ceremony.

Harry is sporting a beard, despite reports he might shave it off in line with Army rules that ban facial hair, but as he is no longer a serving member of the forces, he is allowed to break with convention.
