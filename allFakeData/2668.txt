Teyana Taylor Tickled By Kanye West Dating Gossip, “[They] Got Me Die’N Over Here!”

R&B singer Teyana Taylor has responded to reports suggesting a romantic relationship between her and her new boss, Grammy-winning producer/rapper Kanye West.

Calling out gossip site Media Take Out, Taylor denied the allegations.

“ok…WOW @ MTO. and then WOW @ the ppl who really believed MTO,” she tweeted Monday (March 28).

“lmfaooooooooo this site got me die’n over here with the stories they tell!!! smh lol” (Teyana Taylor’s Twitter)

Reports of the two artists becoming more than friends hit the Internet early Monday.

Kanye West is now hooking up with Teyana Taylor reports MediaTakeOut. The site claims the rapper is head over heels for Taylor and her smoking bod. “Kanye was intrigued by her innocence, and her body,” an insider tells the site, adding, “[Teyana] must have put it on him, all [Kanye] talks about is her … he even signed her to a deal and is featuring her on his new album with Jay-Z.” We thought this rumor smelled fishy because – when is MTO ever correct about a dating story? Anyway, it looks like our suspicion was well placed. (RumorFix)

Earlier this month, female rapper Missy Elliott denied MTO reports connecting her to R&B singer Keri Hilson.

“@MissKeriBaby. Girl It amazes me how we never worked 2gether and barely know each other but they make up a full out lie! Smh!,” she tweeted Friday (March 18). (Missy Elliott’s Twitter)

A day prior to Elliott’s denial, Hilson also resorted to the social network to defend herself.

“Lies!! How do those ppl sleep at night? I love & respect Missy & her work, but we’ve never worked & I’ve prolly seen her 5 times in my life!,” she tweeted Thursday (March 17). (Keri Hilson’s Twitter)
