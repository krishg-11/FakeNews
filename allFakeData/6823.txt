BREAKING: Angelina to wed husband No. 4

Explosive US claims reveal that the 42 year old actress is getting serious with the mystery British millionaire she was linked to last year.



‘There’s a millionaire British philanthropist who she’s been quietly seeing for over a year now,” a friend of Ange’s spilled to Life & Style.



“Gradually, their romance blossomed into real love.”



And they’re wasting no time taking their relationship to the next level, with the publication reporting that Ange is set to say ‘I do’ to husband number four in London later this year.



So it comes as no surprise that the Maleficent star is pushing to finalise her divorce to Brad and moving their six kids – Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and twins Knox and Vivienne, nine – to the U.K in time for the wedding.

“She’s decided to marry her wealthy beau as soon as the ink is dry on the divorce from Brad.



“In fact, Angie’s so in love that she was the one to propose.”



The British ceremony fits in perfectly with the busy actresses work schedule.



Maleficent 2 is set to start filming in London from April to August, and then Ange will be fulfilling her duties as a visiting professor at the London School of Economics.



And the kids couldn’t be happier to see their mum walk down the aisle again.



While Ange is no stranger to weddings – she was married to Brit actor Jonny Lee Miller from 1995 – 1997, Hollywood bad boy Billy Bob Thornton for two years in the early 2000’s, before tying the know with Brad in 2014 – this time she’s convinced she’s found ‘The One’.



“She’s described her beau to friends as handsome, distinguished, bold, witty and one of the kindest souls she’s ever met,” continues the source.



“It’s the most unexpected relationship of Angelina’s life, but she thinks he’s the one person who was truly meant for her.”
