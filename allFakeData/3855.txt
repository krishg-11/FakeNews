Sarah Jessica Parker defended by co-star over Kim Cattrall feud

One of Sarah Jessica Parker's co-stars has jumped to the actor's defence amid her ongoing feud with Kim Cattrall.

Last weekend, Parker was branded “cruel” by Sex and the City co-star Cattrall in a scathing Instagram post which saw her publicly criticise her co-star for a message she sent following the untimely death of her brother, Chris.

Molly Shannon, who plays Parker's friend on HBO series Divorce, has deemed the actor “Hollywood royalty.”

“I didn't read about that but I know, for me, Sarah is just so supportive and so wonderful and we just get along so well,” Shannon told Entertainment Tonight.

Referencing Divorce, which was created by Catastrophe's Sharon Horgan, Shannon continued: “It doesn't really feel like work because we have so much in common, and she loves funny women and is just so genuinely supportive and kind, and, like, a girls' girl.”

Following the sudden death of Cattrall's brother, Parker posted on social media: “Dearest Kim, my love and condolences to you and yours and Godspeed to your beloved brother. Xx.”
