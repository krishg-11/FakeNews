Liam Payne Talks Possibility Of Starting An Acting Career

We may be seeing Liam Payne on the big screen at some point in the near future!

During a recent appearance on MTV‘s ‘TRL‘, the former One Direction singer got the opportunity to answer some fan questions, and when asked if he ever thought about starting an acting career, Liam gave a surprising answer!

He revealed that after having his songs in films, he always thought about what it would be like to act, and we think he’d do an awesome job!

“I’ve always thought about acting and it’s something that I’m really passionate about so I’d like to train first. I feel like you can’t just, I mean I know Harry just walked onto set and was amazing, but I don’t think I have the stuff for that. I think I need a little bit of training and time just to make me feel comfortable to do so.”

ICYMI: Liam recently got real about performing at Nickelodeon’s SlimeFest!
