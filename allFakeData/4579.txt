Kris Jenner begs Kourtney Kardashian to take over the Kardashian empire

Momager Kris Jenner has had it with all the drama so she's reportedly enlisted her eldest child, Kourtney Kardashian to sort shit out.

“She’s the go-to of all the sisters right now, for big picture decisions as well as being the more serious and intellectual face of the brand,” a family insider told Radar Online.

“Khloe’s in the doghouse for sticking with Tristan, while Kim’s very focused on her and Kanye’s dramas and the other girls are too young or inexperienced business-wise.”

“Kris is thrilled with Kourtney’s work rate,” the insider adds. “And the feedback from fans and investors is that Kourtney’s the most relatable, down-to-earth member of the family.”

It's Kourtney to the rescue, fam!
