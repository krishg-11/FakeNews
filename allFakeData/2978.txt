Jennifer Lawrence Calls Out “Sexist” Debate Over Her Versace Dress

On Tuesday, Jennifer Lawrence wore a black Versace gown to a photo-call in London promoting her latest film, Red Sparrow. Some compared the look to Elizabeth Hurley’s famous 90s Versace gown, while others focused on the amount of skin the actress showed while posing outside next to men in suits. The attention surrounding the dress was more than Lawrence preferred, however, and she took to her Facebook account to address it.

“I don’t really know where to get started on this ‘Jennifer Lawrence wearing a revealing dress in the cold’ controversy. This is not only utterly ridiculous, I am extremely offended,” she wrote on Wednesday. “That Versace dress was fabulous, you think I’m going to cover that gorgeous dress up with a coat and a scarf? I was outside for 5 minutes. I would have stood in the snow for that dress because I love fashion and that was my choice.”

She continued to call the discussions “sexist,” saying they were “creating silly distractions from real issues.”

“Get a grip people,” she finished. “Everything you see me wear is my choice. And if I want to be cold THAT’S MY CHOICE TOO!”

Lawrence has since shifted the focus away from her bare limbs and to the crush she shares with most of the Oscar movie-watching planet, Timothée Chalamet. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, the actress described the Call Me by Your Name star as both “hot” and “talented.”

“Timothée, I’m waiting for him to get a little bit older, you know?” she said about the Oscar nominee, who at 22 is only five years her junior. “[I’m] buttering him up like a pig for slaughter, and then I’m going to swing right in there as soon as he’s, like, 30.”
