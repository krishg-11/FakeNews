I knew my baby would feel every stress and every emotion so I chose to do it this way for my little life and our happiness.”

She also releases an 11-minute video documenting her pregnancy and the days leading up to the birth of her daughter:

In a special Pleasure Issue of Playboy, Kylie graces the cover and both she and Travis talk about their sex life. As you do!

Basically, they say their sex life hasn’t changed a bit since Kylie had Stormi. Kylie also says this:

“You remind me that motherhood and sexuality can coexist and just because you embrace your sexuality doesn’t mean you have loose morals or you’re not a good mother. You can be sexy and still be a badass mom.”

October 1, 2019

TMZ reports that Kylie and Travis broke up sometime after their last public appearance on August 27 (which makes those Playboy quotes a little awk in retrospect...).

According to the outlet, Kylie and Travis are “both single” and “walking away from their relationship” after “trying to make the relationship work for a while.”

Even so, not all hope is lost! They’ve apparently taken breaks before and “managed to work it out,” so maybe this isn’t the END end.
