Jennifer Aniston Leans on ‘Friends’ Co-Star Courteney Cox After Justin Theroux Split

After her surprising split from Justin Theroux, Jennifer Aniston seems to be getting some love and support from one of her close friends — Courteney Cox!

On Tuesday night, Aniston appeared to be in good spirits while leaving Courteney’s house in Beverly Hills.

The 49-year-old, who went without her wedding ring, was escorted out by her bodyguard.

Just a day before the split news broke, Aniston and Cox were seen dining together at the Sunset Tower Hotel. A source told Us Weekly, “From the way they were sitting, it seemed like everyone was kind of shielding Jen from the rest of the dining room. They were at a corner table.”

Cox was also on hand to celebrate Aniston’s birthday a few days earlier, while Theroux was on the East Coast.

Despite their split, a source told People magazine that “Justin and Jen still talk all the time.”

The insider added, “She’s in an okay place, as she was in control of the situation.”

Theroux recently returned to social media after the split, posting pics of himself cuddling up to adorable puppies at a dog shelter in Texas.
