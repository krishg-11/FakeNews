Trouble In Paradise? George & Amal Clooney Sleeping In Separate Bedrooms

Trouble In Paradise? George & Amal Clooney Sleeping In Separate Bedrooms ‘She booted him out and he didn’t complain.’

George and Amal Clooney are sleeping in separate beds — but not for the reason most might assume!

According to an insider, Amal banned her husband from the bedroom now that she’s in her third trimester, RadarOnline.com has been told.

“She booted him out and he didn’t complain either,” said the source, who notes that “neither of them have been getting any sleep.”

“He snores like a monster, especially after a few tequilas, while she’s up every hour virtually needing to use the bathroom.”

Despite their overnight separation, continued the insider, George, 55, and 39-year-old Amal reunite “in the mornings for a snuggle and so he can feel his twins jumping about in her tummy.”

“But she has zero libido right now and they both need their sleep, so he knows he’s in the room until the babies’ birth!”
