Chris Hemsworth’s agony over Elsa’s steamy kiss

Chris Hemsworth’s wife Elsa Pataky has been pictured kissing another man, and the sexy shots are sure to send her hunky husband into a jealous frenzy!

The Spanish sex bomb was seen with her legs wrapped around gorgeous Brazilian actor Marco Pigossi as the couple filmed love scenes for the new upcoming Netflix series Tidelands.

The scene was filmed on a remote beach and actress Elsa – dressed in a figure-hugging frock with a sexy side split – revealed her tanned yoga-honed body, while Marco flaunted his buff gym physique, parading around topless for the day.

It’s the first time Elsa has worked with Marco, but the handsome actor is popular for his appearance on soap drama A Forca Do Querer (Edge Of Desire) and is a heart-throb among many female admirers in his home country.

The pair were seen giggling flirtatiously before locking lips in a passionate embrace.

‘The chemistry was electric,’ said one onlooker.

It’s a rare turn of events for Elsa, as Thor star Chris is often the one busy shooting movie scenes, while his wife stays home looking after their children, India Rose, six, and four-year-old twins, Tristan and Sasha.
