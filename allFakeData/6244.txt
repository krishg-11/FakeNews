Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi 'going to pot' to save marriage?

Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi's relationship is hanging by a thread, it has been claimed. A celebrity gossip website has come up with claims that the couple is fighting non-stop behind the closed doors.

According to Radar Online, the 59-year-old talk show host and the 44-year-old former actress recently had a massive fight during a private party held at their Hollywood Hills home. However, things cooled down after Rossi "sneaked off to a nearby bedroom and returned with a lit joint."

A source told the website: "It was a very awkward night for a while. But everything got really mellow once the spliff was passed around."

"Ellen and Portia were carrying on like a couple of happy high schoolers," the insider added.

DeGeneres has apparently quit drinking, which was earlier cited as reason for difference between them. The source shared: "Ellen has always been a drinker, but she does not drink on set or when she is working. That does not seem to be their problem right now."

DeGeneres married the Australian-American actress in 2008 at their home in Beverly Hills after the state of California lifted its ban on same-sex marriages.

The couple have repeatedly denied reports that they are trying to hide their marital problems.

Portia told ET: "We're just really good friends and we talk about everything, and we never ever, ever lie to each other, like, not even the tiniest lies. And she's the only person I want to hang out with. Like, she is my best friend and I just want to be with her all the time."
