Now, according to a report by In Touch, Brad has won a major victory in the wake of their bitter split.

After months of biding his time, Brad's waiting has finally paid off!

A source close to the actor told In Touch, 'Brad's finally got the kids, and he's overjoyed.

'To Brad's delight, Angelina has decided to let the majority of the children, who have summer camps and a slew of other activities in the works, stay in LA with their father while she's in Britain filming Maleficent 2.'

Brad was reportedly livid when Angelina told him she'd found a home in London to live in with all six children while she filmed the Disney sequel, 'but to keep him from fighting her on it,' a friend tells, 'she promised Brad that he could spend longer periods with their children.'

In Touch's report claims that's what their children want too.

The 54-year-old actor, 'couldn't be happier' according to In Touch, because now he knows he'll have his quality time with all six children.

In Touch's report further reveals Brad's already preparing his LA home.

'He gets such enjoyment out of seeing them cut loose at their amusement park-like former home,' the friend tells the publication. 'So, he's really spruced up the pool area, the skateboard ramp and the bike track.'

Spending time with his kids over the summer could give the actor the leverage he needs to get joint custody once and for all.

'He's been patient long enough,' says the friend. 'Something's got to give. Angelina can't control everything forever.'

Neither Brad or Angelina have responded to In Touch's report.
