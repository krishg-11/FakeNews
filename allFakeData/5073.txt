A Very Comprehensive 10-Year Timeline of Justin Bieber & Hailey Baldwin's Relationship

May 27, 2018: Friends Again

After almost two years of not speaking, Hailey Baldwin confirmed in May of this year that she and JB are friends again. "Justin and I were friends for a long time," she said in an interview with The Times UK. "I met him when I was really young and he was one of my best friends. Everybody knows that at a certain point in time that turned into something else, but that just happens when you’re 18, 19. We went through a long period of time when we weren’t friends. We didn’t speak for quite some time and there was a lot of weirdness that went on. We’ve moved past that."
