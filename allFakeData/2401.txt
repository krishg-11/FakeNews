She's got a name!

After Kim Kardashian and Kanye West announced they welcomed baby No. 3, the E! reality star revealed their daughter's special moniker. World: Meet Chicago West! Kim shared the name of the baby girl on her app Friday. She then tweeted, "North, Saint & Chi."

In response to Kim's announcement, Khloe Kardashian tweeted that she loved the baby's name and shared how they pronounce her nickname. "I LOOOOOOOOOOVE her name hey Chi (shy)," she wrote.

The celebrity couple's newest bundle of joy joins 4-year-old North West and 2-year-old Saint West as the youngest West sibling and latest addition to the ever-expanding Kardashian family.

"Kanye and I are happy to announce the arrival of our healthy, beautiful baby girl," Kim revealed on her app Tuesday.

North and Saint are especially thrilled to welcome their baby sister." Their daughter was born Jan. 15 at 12:47 a.m. PT and weighed 7 lbs., 6 oz., Kim added.
