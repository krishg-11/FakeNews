Brad Pitt Is Writing A Tell-All & THIS Is What's In It!

Brad Pitt has taken to paper and pencil in order to cope with his divorce from Angelina Jolie. The actor, who has been making headlines lately for his rapid weight loss, is said to be writing a tell-all — and he’s already 300 pages in! Click through to learn more about Brad’s alleged memoir.

Sources tell Life & Style, “Brad has been writing about his journey and finding it therapeutic. He’s completed almost 300 pages. And he’s been very blunt in describing what led to the breakdown of his marriage.”

The insider continues, “Angie’s concerned about Brad releasing his writings as a tell-all book because of the impact it could have on their kids.”

But the snitch insists the A-Lister “isn’t interested in taking down Angie.”

“He largely blames his own emotional baggage and drinking for their problems, and he’s offered to let Angie read what he’s written,” the source says, adding that Brad’s intentions are “to help others going through similar issues.”
