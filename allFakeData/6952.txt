Liam Hemsworth To Miley Cyrus: Ditch Drugs — Or We’re Done

Unhappy hunk Liam Hemsworth has smacked his trainwreck fiancée Miley Cyrus with a sobriety ultimatum — give up the drugs or the wedding is off!

Fed up with her erratic, drug-fueled “bad girl” behavior, the 27-year-old “Hunger Games” adonis blew his stack at his Jan. 13 birthday party after the “Wrecking Ball” singer “disappeared” into the ladies’ room for some extracurricular activity, a spy exclusively spilled to The National ENQUIRER.

“Miley’s drug problem has been an ongoing issue ever since she and Liam got back together,” the source said, “but it’s taken a really bad turn and gotten worse in the last several weeks.

“Liam wants her to cut the crap and get healthy and get help because he loves her.”

The on-again, off-again couple officially broke off their engagement in 2013 but reconciled last year when the tongue-wagging 24-year-old emerged wearing a gold diamond band on her left ring finger.

What’s more, a second source dished that pot-smoking Miley had briefly behaved when first getting back together with Liam.

She soon, however, tumbled once more off the wagon.

“It’s so sad,” the source told The ENQUIRER. “She’s just a lost cause!”
