New Idea

Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston reunite with a wedding a baby

Sources close to the Friends star reveal that she and Brad took off to a remote island in the Caribbean last week with just a handful of friends, holding a romantic, intimate commitment ceremony on a quiet beach. And in a surprise new twist, it’s believed Jen is already a long way through the process of adopting a baby – with Jen telling friends she ‘can’t wait’ to have a family with Brad.

The shock developments come as respected US website TMZ reveals that Jen and Justin may never have been married in the first place, making it easier for Jen to make her renewed romance with Brad official so soon.
