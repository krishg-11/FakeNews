Brad Pitt moves in with Kate Hudson

Brad Pitt is moving forward in his divorce from Angelina Jolie, and making plans to formally move in with new love Kate Hudson, US magazine Star is reporting.

The actor, 53, has been spending a LOT of his down time with Kate, 37, at her Pacific Palisades, California home.

“They’ve been secretly meeting up since they first got together two months ago,” says Star’s source. “And as he gets closer to actually cutting the cord with Angie, Brad will have even more time to spend with Kate. When that happens, I think it won’t take long until he takes the next big step and actually moves in with Kate.”

Between Brad’s six kids and her two, “it’s going to be like a funhouse,” the source says.

Although the couple didn’t attend the Golden Globes together on January 8, they reportedly hooked up later.

“There were whispers that they were going to meet up afterward at Brad’s place in Los Feliz,” the source says, adding that’s a change of pace for the star who once shared the compound with Angelina and their brood.

“In a way, having Kate come over shows just how much Brad is letting her into his life,” says the source, adding, “Still, they prefer to spend evenings at Kate’s place.”
