Why Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle 'can't stand each other'

Behind the beaming public smiles, pregnant Kate and bride-to-be Meghan, 'hate each others guts', according to the publication's explosive report.

'Their relationship is a hotbed of jealousy, backstabbing and ego!' a royal insider spills. 'They put on a friendly front when they have to appear at events together, but the truth is they'll never be BFFs.'

GLOBE claims the royal feud exploded when Harry and Meghan announced their engagement, leaving the royal women to become neighbours.

'Kate was shocked to see some of Meghan's sex scenes from her TV series Suits, and was just as horrified as the Queen when Meghan wore a daring top for her engagement photos,' the source tells.

With Harry's big day approaching, Kate is terrified he is making the wrong decision!

'Kate adores Harry and wants him to have the family he's always dreamed of,' says a palace insider. 'But, she's worried he's fallen for Meghan for all the wrong reasons.'

GLOBE's royal insider adds Harry has fallen for Meghan's 'Hollywood status', and Meghan is playing a role to keep her man happy.

GLOBE's sensational report reveals Harry and older brother William are at their 'wits end' and can't believe their partner's aren't getting along!

'For the desperate princes, it's a race against time to get their women to call a truce,' a palace insider revealed.
