Anne Hathaway is reportedly pregnant with her first child. Hurrah!

According to E! News, the 32-year-old actress and her producer husband Adam Shulman, 34, are set to welcome the bundle of cuteness next year, although they are yet to confirm this.

A source said: "Anne is in her second trimester and feeling great!"

The Devil Wears Prada star was spotted out and about in Beverly Hills earlier this week with what appeared to be a baby bump.

Anne and Adam married in 2012 and she has previously spoken of her desire to start a family.

She said: "Oh my God. I want to be a mother and I anticipate loving my children quite fiercely. I think about it all the time, though it's a silly thing to think about because the kind of mother I'll be depends on the kind of children I have. I can't wait to meet them."

Anne also admitted that she and Adam had been trying to decide where to live once they have children as she wants to keep their offspring out of the spotlight.

"I'm thinking about that [the paparazzi] because I really want to have a baby, and my husband and I are like, 'Where are we gonna live?'" she said.

If the rumours are true we imagine all she'll be bothered about is trying to get as much sleep as possible.

Mirror Celebs has contacted Anne's rep for an official commnet.
