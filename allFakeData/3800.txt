Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott: A Timeline of Their Relationship

Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott have gone their separate ways. Us Weekly confirmed in October 2019 that the couple are taking a break after dating for more than two years.

The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star and the rapper went public with their romance at Coachella in April 2017, just weeks after she split from her on-off boyfriend of four years, Tyga. They welcomed their daughter, Stormi, in February 2018.
