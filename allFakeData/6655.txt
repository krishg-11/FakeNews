A Source Reported That Blake Shelton Is Cheating On Gwen Stefani – Their Friends Still Believe That The Couple Will Walk Down The Aisle Someday

An insider made a horrible report saying that Blake Shelton is cheating on Gwen Stefani. In case you are wondering who is the lady that he’s cheating with, it’s Chloe Kohanski. She won the 13th season of The Voice.

A source discussed with Life & Style magazine and said that Gwen hates how close Blake and this young lady have become lately.

Gwen does not like the fake student-teacher relationship between the two especially since Chloe won the title at the end of 2017.

Gwen reportedly canceled their wedding plans. The singer’s insecurity might be rooted in her past when she was also cheated by her ex-husband, Gavin Rossdale. He had an affair with their kids’ nanny at the time.

After what happened in the past, Gwen could not handle something like that anymore, and she is becoming more and more insecure these days regarding her beau.

Even if these two have such problems, it seems that their friends are still hoping that they will be able to solve them and get married just as planned.

The same insider stated that trust is an essential thing in a relationship and while this lacks from Gwen and Blake’s romance, there’s no point that these two get married. Neither one of them wants another divorce.

Gwen and Blake still have to address these cheating rumors because nothing has been officially confirmed. We just have to wait and see what’s the truth behind these allegations, but it would be such a pity to see this beautiful couple destroyed by cheating.
