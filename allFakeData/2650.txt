Why Debra Messing Was Nervous to Star in 'Searching'

Debra Messing and John Cho star in the groundbreaking new thriller Searching, which is generating serious buzz for how it was made.

The entire story unfolds entirely through the POV of technology screens - video chats, Google searches, text messages and the like. While the original take on how this film was made is now the talk of Hollywood at first it made both actors reluctant to get involved.

John even turned down the role before the director won him over and Debra explained to EurWeb why she eventually signed on, saying:

“I really believe in instinct and I believe in trying to silence the voice that says, ‘what will other people think about this choice’ and does this excite me, will this challenge me, does it scare me? You answer yes to those, you have to do it.”

Searching is in theaters today.
