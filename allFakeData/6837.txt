Mariah's cash crisis

Mariah's cash crisis Wednesday 18 July 2001



Mariah Carey says that despite signing a mega �60m three-album deal with Virgin recently, she has suffered from money problems. Carey told The Sun newspaper, "I signed my life away at an early age. When you're used to having five dollars a week and then some guy comes along and says you can have a million dollars but this guy's going to take half of it then you say 'no problem.' You don't think about things like that."

Mariah says a series of bad business decisions and her short marriage to Sony chief Tommy Mottola, 52, left her with a cash crisis. "Basically, until my last album, Rainbow, I was giving my money to someone else," says Mariah. The star adds that her current Virgin deal "doesn't feel real" because "if I haven't even seen the money I don't feel it exists. My mother and I moved around 13 times when I was young. She never owned her own home so I always have this feeling that the rug could be pulled out from under my feet at any time. I've never felt secure. I don't really believe the money is there. I don't really spend that much on myself. In this business there are so many sharks and I have come into contact with some of the worst."

Mariah who is dating Latin singer Luis Miguel refuses to comment on her relationship. "The thing is careerwise, no matter who you're with, I think the best idea is to always say as little as possible."

Mariah's new single, Loverboy is expected to enter the Top 10 on Sunday. Mariah's new movie, Glitter, opens in the US on 31 August. (Worldpop)
