Pregnant Jessica Simpson's Super-Tight Dress—See the Pic!

Jessica Simpson looks ready to pop!

The mama of one (and soon to be two) was all smiles when she stepped out in Ojai, Calif., accompanied by her sister Ashlee, her adorable daughter Maxwell, nephew Bronx Mowgli Wentz and a large group of pals.

The blond beauty—who is expecting a baby boy this summer—wore a skin-tight black dress, showing off her growing belly as she gently touched her tummy. She accessorized her pregnancy chic fashion with oversized shades and a bright orange Birkin bag, looking radiant as she enjoyed the sunny afternoon.
