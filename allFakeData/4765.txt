A younger-than-normal audience packed The View's studio on Wednesday morning in order to see their pop idol Taylor Swift, live and in person. Swift's new album1989has already shot to the top on iTunes and has received favorable reviews from critics but her label, Big Machine Records, might not have been so confident that this offering from Swift would be a success.

"I wasn't necessarily nervous about this album," Swift said. "I think my label might have been a little nervous but they'll never say it now."

Swift, whose roots were initially planted in country music, is now going full-steam ahead into Top 40 fare with 1989.

"I knew I wanted to change the way I did things creatively," Swift told the View co-hosts. "I knew I wanted to keep people on their toes. I didn't want anyone to have their feelings hurt by me changing directions creatively, because that's never the intention."

With lyrics about empowerment and ridding one's self of negativity, Swift is once again being lauded as a feminist for a younger generation.

"It's interesting how feminism has come up in conversation so much more in the last year," Swift said. "I was never really taught the definition of feminism when I was a little girl and I wish I had been."

Whether her constant astonishment at her own overwhelming success is genuine or just false modesty is still undeterminable. Confident as she may be, Swift admits that she still fears failure.

"How do you not know how awesome you are?" Nicolle Wallace asked.

"I keep a nice healthy level of insecurity going at all times," said Swift.
