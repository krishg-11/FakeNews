REPORT: Khloe Kardashian Pays a Ton for Off-Duty Cops to Follow Tristan Thompson Around

With LeBron James gone and Kevin Love potentially on the move at some point via trade, Tristan Thompson will have to step up even more and play better than he ever has for a Cleveland Cavaliers team with overpaid and underperforming players.





As sad as that sounds.





It's going to be hard for him to put in the work this offseason and focus on basketball, however, girlfriend Khloe Kardashian has reportedly hired a team of off-duty cops to follow Tristan around to make sure he doesn't cheat on her again.

That's certainly one way to try and save a relationship. An expensive way, too, at a reported $1,000-plus per day. Cavs fans, you have to hope that Khloe and ​TT figure it out sooner rather than later, because this is just ridiculous.

We're not so sure that those seats will fill up just to watch Tristan score almost six points in 20 minutes of play. Maybe Khloe will fill up the arena with her off-duty cops? There's your season ticket problem solved right there.





Get your act together, big man. Be a good dad and a good boyfriend so we can talk about you as a basketball player agai
