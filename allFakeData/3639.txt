Don Rickles dies: Celebrities pay tribute

Hollywood is mourning the loss of Don Rickles, the actor-turned-insult-comic who died Thursday at the age 90.

Rickles, who appeared on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson more than 100 times and starred in John Landisâ€™ Emmy Award-winning documentary about himself (Mr. Warmth), also voiced Mr. Potato Head on Toy Story and appeared on the Tonight Show to turn his harsh humor on host Jimmy Fallon.

In the wake of his death, celebrities and fellow comedians (many of whom had been influenced by Rickles) took to social media to pay tribute to the comedy giant in a series of heartfelt posts.

In lieu of flowers, Don Rickles' family has requested that people drop their pants and fire a rocket. #RIPDonRickles â€” Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) April 6, 2017
