Blac Chyna's Lawsuit Against the Kardashians Has Taken a New Twist

Blac Chyna's ongoing legal battle with the Kardashians has taken an interesting new turn as Rob Kardashian's ex and the mother of his child, Dream, has added Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner to her lawsuit against the reality TV family â€” months after she had dismissed them from the case, according to TMZ.

Chyna is suing the Kardashian family because she claims they played a role in the cancellation of her E! reality show, Rob & Chyna. However, the family maintains the show ended after she got a restraining order against Rob, making it difficult to film a show about them. Blac Chyna first filed the lawsuit back in October 2017. Just last month, Kris Jenner and Kim Kardashian were tentatively dismissed from the case.

It's not completely clear, TMZ notes, why the sisters were added back to the lawsuit. Though, allegedly, shady comments were made about the show by one or both of the women.

As for Kim and Kris, after they were tentatively dismissed, the judge did allow for Blac Chyna to someday create a new case against them in the future, should she want to do that.
