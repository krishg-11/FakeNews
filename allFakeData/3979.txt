On Wednesday the Keeping up with the Kardashian star posted a cryptic photo to her Instagram account that appears to be hinting at the name of her daughter— and based on these indications we believe the baby’s name is Elle V. West.

Clue 1: The reality star posted a picture of the Louis Vuitton logo—LV. “L” which sounds like “Elle” and “V” which is the roman numeral number for five. This seems like a strong possibility because the new addition makes five at the West household as she joins big brother Saint, 2, and big Sister North, 4.

Clue 2: As some may know, Elle also means “She” in French and Kim confirmed that she was having a girl on the Ellen DeGeneres show earlier this month as well as on her website when she announced the arrival of their daughter saying “She is here.” Was this a double entendre?

Clue 3: Fans may also recall that when Kim made an appearance on the show, Ellen had fans scream out suggestion for KKW beauty founder and at one point someone screamed out “Elle” and Ellen agreed saying, “Elle that’s a good one! E-L-L-E!”

Clue 4: During that same appearance, Ellen also suggested that she name the baby “Three” for baby number three, which may have sparked the train of thought to consider the numeral symbolism “V” in her family tree.
