Fans Think Kylie Jenner Looks Like "Old Kylie" After She Removes All Her Filler

Wow was there a lot of celebrity news breaking on Sunday night. Sure Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin's got engaged, but also, Kylie Jenner has returned to her old face.

The signature pout that helped the reality star launch her beauty empire Kylie Cosmetics—featuring the highly-coveted Kylie Lip Kits—is no longer, according to a photo the beauty mogul posted to her Instagram on Sunday.

"[S]he looks like the old Kylie here and idk why," one fan commented under the picture of Jenner and her best friend Anastasia Karanikolaou, to which Kylie responded, "i got rid of all my filler," adding two shocked emojis and a smiling face emoji. Another fan praised Jenner for embracing an all natural look, writing, "YESSS KYLIE!!! you look stunning w more natural looking lips. i stan this we STAN," with Kylie replying to the fan with a few heart face emojis.

Jenner confirmed that her pumped up pout (which inspired the #KylieJennerChallenge, in which fans would use small cups to plump their lips) was a result of lip injections during an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians in 2015.

A year later in an interview with Complex, Jenner admitted that she may have gone too far with the lip injections. "When you first get them done, you’re like, ‘Oh, it could be a little bit bigger on that side.’ I’d go back and be like, ‘They went down’ and think they could be bigger. But I went too far. It was very painful," she explained. "It’s annoying to hear every day that you’re just this fake, plastic person when you’re not.”
