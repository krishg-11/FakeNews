RYAN REYNOLDS ALWAYS has some kind of joke to play on friends and family when a birthday rolls around.

He doesn’t even hold back when it’s his wife. Last august, he shared this photo of himself and wife Blake Lively and wrote “Happy Birthday to my amazing wife.”

Don’t worry. Blake got her revenge on Ryan’s birthday in October.

He sent the former One Direction star a video of himself in character as Deadpool. He opened by saying “Zayn! It’s Wade. Don’t hang up!” (Wade is Deadpool’s ‘real’ name).

I just wanna wish you a very happy birthday. Again. Uh, I also want to apologise for jumping out of the cake like that. I didn’t realise it was the middle of the night, I had no idea it was in the middle of your bedroom.

I wanna thank your securty… who were very, very gentle… and creative with uh, the taser. So, anyway. Happy birthday to you and Mr. Tim Horton. You share your birthday with a very special Canadian who is very near and dear to my heart.

We look forward to seeing Ryan Reynolds’ next birthday wish.
