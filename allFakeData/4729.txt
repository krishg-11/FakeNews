President Donald Trump retweeted a cartoon of a train killing a CNN reporter

President Donald Trump sparked outrage after he retweeted a cartoon "Trump Train" running into a person bearing the CNN logo for a head on Tuesday morning. He has since deleted the tweet.

"Fake news can't stop the Trump Train," the cartoon meme, which was initially shared by one of his supporters, was captioned.

The president's decision to retweet the cartoon was criticized by some reporters, who compared it to the deadly rally that took place over the weekend in Charlottesville -- resulting in the death of at least three victims.

"The meme that Trump retweeted after Heather Heyer was killed by a Nazi-living protester's car in Charlottesville," one reporter tweeted, while another wrote: "After a woman was fatally run over at a white nationalist rally, the president shares a rendering of a 'TRUMP' train hitting a CNN reporter."

According Breitbart, the original Trump image was a cartoon created by artist Gary Varvel, showing Democrats unsuccessfully trying to stop the "Trump Train."
