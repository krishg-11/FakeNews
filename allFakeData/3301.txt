Will Jennifer Aniston And Brad Pitt Give Love A Second Chance?

Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux are done.

They announced plans to divorce after being married for more than 2 years.

The former couple revealed they split up at the end of 2017 and that the separation was ‘mutual and loving.’

They plan to remain best friends.

The normally private pair decided to break the news of their break-up with a statement from their publicist.

“Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly.”

Jennifer Aniston is one of those celebs that people pull for.

She’s low key, low scandal, seemingly low maintenance.

We want her to find everlasting love.

So, what if Jenn got back together with Brad Pitt?

They were Hollywood’s it couple when they married in July 2000, but the relationship ended 5-years-later when Aniston filed for divorce.

Brad is single now too, having split with Angelina Jolie in 2016.

There was that rumor that he reached out to Jennifer after the break-up and E! News reported in January that Brad is casually getting back into the dating scene.

They wouldn’t be the first celebrity couple to give love a second shot.

Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth are back on after breaking off their engagement in 2013.

She’s now wearing the ring he proposed with.

Plus, singer Pink and her husband Carey Hart separated after two years of marriage, but never divorced and rekindled their relationship a year later.

Justin Timberlake split with Jessica Biel in the spring of 2011 and by December of the same year they were engaged.
