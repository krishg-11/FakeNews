Jennifer Aniston: Why I will never be a mum

Jennifer Aniston has made the dramatic decision to finally walk away from her baby dreams, according to a report out of the US today.

The 48-year-old actress, who is facing reports of a split from hubby Justin Theroux, has spent years of heartache trying for her dream baby to no avail. However sources tell US magazine Life & Style that she has given up on ever having a child, and washed her hands of baby expectations – ‘those put on her by society and fans, and those she put on herself’.

Having once gushed in her twenties about wanting ‘to be a young mom’ to three, Jen has now completely come into her own. ‘I feel better in my 40s,’ she says. ‘Not only do you feel better in your body physically, but you’re mentally better.’

An insider tells Life & Style, ‘Jen loves her free-spirit life, being able to travel or get up and go whenever she wants, with no notice,’ pointing out she’s been to Berlin, Mexico and now Paris over the past six months.

Now Jen, who is godmum to Courteney Cox’s daughter Coco, finds she gets her ‘maternal’ fill from her numerous projects and charity work with children’s hospitals. ‘You may not have a child come out of your vagina,’ says Jen, ‘but that doesn’t mean you aren’t mothering – dogs, friends, friends’ children.’
