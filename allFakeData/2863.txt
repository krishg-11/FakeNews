Ariel Winter's Fake Baby Voice Will Make You Instantly Uncomfortable

Everyone has at least one weird, useless talent (think rolling your tongue or being able to lick your elbow).

Ariel Winter's secret weird talent is actually kind of creepy and freaks everyone who witnesses it out: She can do a really high-pitched baby voice.

While promoting Smurfs: The Lost Village, Ariel revealed that unlike most of her previous animated voice work, she got to use her real voice instead of a fake one. That's when she clued everyone watching into the fact that she's actually a pro at doing voices, and her fake baby voice is one that her boyfriend and her friends would rather her not do.

Why? you ask. Well, because her baby voice isn't cute and cuddly like in an episode of Peppa Pig. No, it's straightup terrifying. Like straight out of Chucky.

Check it out below and get ready to criiiiiiinge.

At least in Ariel's case, her fake voice skills pay off… literally. She gets paid big bucks to use them in movies, so more power to her!
