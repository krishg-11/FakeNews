Victoria Beckham pokes fun at husband David's popularity after Royal Wedding backlash

The 44-year-old made the most of the good weather today, as she took a stroll with the former professional footballer.

Treating fans to a clip from their day out, David could be seen feeding some ducks as the duo spent time in a park.

The fashion-forward star sported an all-black ensemble, as he donned a pair of jeans, a hooded jumper and matching flat cap.

Laughing at the attention the animals were paying to the 43-year-old, Victoria teased her husband over his popularity.

As she videoed her spouse, the former Spice Girls star exclaimed: “Even the ducks like you!”
