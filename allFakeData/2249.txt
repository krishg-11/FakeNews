James Comey testifies before Congress: Celebrities react on Twitter

A day after releasing an advance copy of his opening statement, former F.B.I. director James Comey arrived on Capitol Hill Thursday to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday.

The public portion of Comey’s highly anticipated testimony is being broadcast on a number of TV networks and online platforms, and marks the first time the former F.B.I. director will speak publicly since he was fired by President Donald Trump last month.

With all eyes on Washington, many reacted on Twitter as Comey was questioned by the 15-member group about his private conversations with the president earlier this year regarding the F.B.I.‘s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian forces during the 2016 election.

See below for reactions from celebrities and other public figures.

Comey is the first person I've ever heard who hopes he was being taped. "are you wearing a wire? WELL WHY NOT" — Aparna Nancherla (@aparnapkin) June 8, 2017

Highlight so far, right at the start, Comey testifies that President Trump “lied" (about the FBI being in disarray). — Dan Rather (@DanRather) June 8, 2017

Someone said there are more people lined up to watch Comey's testimony than there were at the inauguration. 😂💀 — Retta (@unfoRETTAble) June 8, 2017

#comey adds “Lordy, I hope there are tapes.” — Katie Couric (@katiecouric) June 8, 2017

"Lordy, I hope there are tapes," Comey notes. Us, too. #ComeyTestimony — deray (@deray) June 8, 2017

I need 'Lordy, I hope there are tapes' on a t-shirt — Chris Evans (@ChrisEvans) June 8, 2017

only in 2017 would one be launching a tour and watching comey testify at the same time — Lorde (@lorde) June 8, 2017

If you say Trump's inexperience is a legit alibi, you're admitting you voted for a POTUS who doesn't know how to be President. Good job! — Andy Richter (@AndyRichter) June 8, 2017

Damn! Comey just made me emotional with opening remarks. Didn't expect that. — Ana Navarro (@ananavarro) June 8, 2017

He appears to be confusing two very separate investigations. https://t.co/xXI8wfCksQ — igorvolsky (@igorvolsky) June 8, 2017

The Comey hearings are even more fun if you sing "Karma Chameleon" to yourself as "Comey Chameleon" whoops sorry now it's in your head too. — @midnight (@midnight) June 8, 2017

Comey says that disturbed him. Fascinating. — Bill O'Reilly (@BillOReilly) June 8, 2017

Buy a drink for every reporter who hasn't described the Comey hearing as a "blockbuster". — Ronan Farrow (@RonanFarrow) June 8, 2017

While the nation is at risk from international terrorism, Comey's sole objective is to trip up his superiors actually trying to fight terror — Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) June 8, 2017

Comey has two waters on his desk and the pattern with which he drinks them will deliver a binary message. Pay close attention. pic.twitter.com/bx3HF8O3II — Full Frontal (@FullFrontalSamB) June 8, 2017

If Comey screams "You can't handle the truth!" we all win. — Zach Braff (@zachbraff) June 8, 2017

#Comey just said he kept notes on meetings with @realDonaldTrump b/c of the "nature of the person" being a liar. WOW! #TrumpLiar — MazJobrani (@MazJobrani) June 8, 2017

Somewhere, Jared is letting Donald beat him at Mario Kart. — Tim Federle (@TimFederle) June 8, 2017

I would not want to play poker with James Comey. Just saying, that is one still face. — Alyssa Rosenberg (@AlyssaRosenberg) June 8, 2017

I don’t normally like courtroom dramas, but I’m transfixed by this one. Tune in live now! https://t.co/R4uQBMbCfd #JamesComey — Misha Collins (@mishacollins) June 8, 2017

Comey rn: He a lie. He know he a lie. I took receipts! #ComeyHearing — Ashley Black (@ashleyn1cole) June 8, 2017

@realDonaldTrump make sure to go to the bathroom now. You don't wanna miss any of this #ComeyDay — MazJobrani (@MazJobrani) June 8, 2017

Nice of Burr to TWICE invoke the Steele Dossier so clumsily that Comey can't answer it in public and must leave it sound entirely verified — Keith Olbermann (@KeithOlbermann) June 8, 2017

Nice to see a Burr working against treason for once. — Full Frontal (@FullFrontalSamB) June 8, 2017
