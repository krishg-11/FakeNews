All the Times Kate Middleton and Prince Harry Have Teased Prince William About His (Lack of) Hair

While Prince William may lead the charmed life of a royal, it can't be easy having a wife with perfect hair and a brother who is a pro at cracking jokes.

The Duke of Cambridge has endured years of humiliation as a result of his receding hair line and most recently became the butt of a joke thanks to wife Kate Middleton, who couldn't help but poke fun at her husband's bald spot during the twosome's tour Down Under.

While watching a shearing demonstration, Lyn Crejan, a farmer from Glenn Innes in New South Wales, showed the couple a tuft of alpaca wool that just so happened to be a similar shade to William's hair. "The prince was interested in the alpaca, and as I showed it to them, the princess said he should put it on his head," Crejan told reporters. "She said, 'You need it more than me,' and pointed to his head and he laughed."

Of course, this isn't the first time that William's receding hair line has become the topic of conversation. Here is every time the royal family has joked about the duke's lack of hair.
