Fergie Addresses Plastic Surgery Rumors In Cosmo UK

Fergie was rumored to have gone under the knife before appearing on 'American Idol' earlier this year, and she tells Cosmo UK that story was "ridiculous."

“I read that I’d spent about $30,000 or something," she tells the magazine. "It’s just ridiculous. We had a laugh about it. So many rumours have been spread over the years and you have to learn, especially in this business, to just laugh it off. If you stress about it, you’ll drive yourself crazy.”

The speculation over the Black Eyed Peas singer's face grew so feverish after her March performance that her husband, Josh Duhamel, spoke out in her defense.

"I thought she looked amazing," he told Ryan Seacrest. "It's amazing. You put a different color on your lips and, uh, rumors fly. But she's the same, she's the same Fergie... I sleep right next to her every night. I like it."

Fergie, who has previously admitted she controls her weight by telling herself food is poison, told Cosmo UK a more sensible story about her diet.

“For me, healthy eating and exercising is something I work on constantly," she said. "I’m not the most disciplined dieter. I try to eat a lot of fruit and vegetables but sometimes late at night I tend to have fast-food meals – and that’s where I get myself into trouble! So I’m not in the best shape I could be, but I’m still healthy and comfy. You know, I’m a curvy woman and I just want to be comfortable with that.”
