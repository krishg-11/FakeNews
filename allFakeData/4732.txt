"They'd love an intimate ceremony in Mexico with just their friends and family," an insider claims. "It was always 'their place'."

However, there is no rush as they are both 'just happy being back together', according to the magazine.

Last week, Jennifer announced her split from husband Justin Theroux after two-and-a-half-years of marriage.

The former couple said the decision to separate 'was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year' in a statement issued through the Friends star's publicist, Stephen Huvane.
