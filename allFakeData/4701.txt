Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's divorce and custody proceedings stall again, plus more news

Judge extends Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's custody and divorce proceedings

Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie could be looking at another whole year of drawn-out split negotiations. According to In Touch, the two requested more time to work out agreements for the custody of their six children and the distribution of their assets earlier this month. "They had been diligently going along privately and amicably, trying to keep the focus on the family," says a source. "But suddenly, Angelina reversed course when she felt Brad was pushing too hard to resolve the situation to his benefit." A court order excepted by the tab states, "The completion date for all proceedings before the temporary judge is extended from Dec. 31, 2017, to Dec. 31, 2018." Says the insider: "This means their custody battle can drag on for another year." Brad and Angelina split in September 2016. Their current custody deal gives Angelina primary custody while Brad gets visitation. He's reportedly asking for joint custody. Meanwhile, an OK report claiming the two are calling off the divorce altogether has been debunked by Gossip Cop.
