Humiliation for Kris Jenner: Why toyboy Corey dumped her

Kris, 61, and 36-year-old Corey haven’t been seen together in public since Valentine’s Day - and even then they hardly looked loved up.

‘Corey was traipsing around behind Kris holding her handbag. It was like she barely registered he was there,’ says an eyewitness who spotted them out in LA.

In a blow to Kris’ ego, it’s believed that Corey, Justin Bieber’s former road manager, initiated their break-up.

‘She had been nagging him about a number of things for a while, including the fact that he wasn’t spending as much time with her as she’d like, and he just couldn’t take it anymore,' says Star’s source, who adds that Kris is devastated.

‘She can’t stand to be alone. But I suspect she and Corey may have actually put on a united front in public for some time, since ratings have been way down for Keeping Up With The Kardashians. Kris is obsessed with maintaining the impression that everything is wonderful.
