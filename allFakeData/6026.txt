We hate to be the bearer of bad news for Lady Gaga.

The singer said on Monday that she still loves ex-fiancé Taylor Kinney and joked she won’t be celebrating when he starts to date again. But Page Six is told that the “Chicago Fire” actor — who was engaged to Gaga for 18 months until their July split — has already moved on.

Insiders say that Kinney has been quietly dating a 26-year-old girl from South Philadelphia, Alanna DiGiovanni, and unlike his ex’s alter ego, we’re told she’s not a Fame Monster: DiGiovanni is a former Atlantic City bottle-service waitress who now works in radiology at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital.

Kinney and DiGiovanni recently visited Austin, Texas, together to attend the Formula One race and Taylor Swift concert, and we’re told DiGiovanni has visited him in Chicago, where he shoots the NBC show.

“Alanna is head over heels,” we’re told. “He’s told her he’s planning to visit her in Philly; maybe as soon as this weekend.”

Gaga — whose new album, “Joanne” was released on Friday — said on Howard Stern’s Sirius XM show on Monday, “I’m actually very close to Taylor. He’s been my lover and my friend for a really long time,” adding that there’s “a lot on this record inspired by our relationship.” But asked if she would be happy if Kinney started dating again, she said, “I’m not going to f - - king throw a party!”
