Gal Gadot's daughters not impressed with mum's 'Wonder Woman' character

The whole world was in awe of Gal Gadot's portrayal of 'Wonder Woman', but it seems like her kids are more concerned about their food than mom playing the Amazonian princess.

According to E! Online, Gadot shared that her youngest daughter, Maya is only nine months old and has no clue who her mother famously plays, but her eldest Alma, is aware of her mother's fame.

She said, "At the house I am the mother; I am not the star or the character or anything. I am their mother, so it is like, 'Mom, I am hungry.'"

The 'Keeping up with the Jones' star also revealed that her little girl really likes Batman, but also makes sure that she is "very proud" of her.

During the interview, she also praised her 'Justice League' co-star Ezra Miller, who portrays the role of 'The Flash' in the movie.

Gadot applauded his performance in the movie and noted, "I can never get tired of saying it: He brought such unique qualities to his character. He completely stole the thunder on this movie. He is so good."

Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) will join her fellow superheroes The Flash (Ezra Miller), Batman (Ben Affleck), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Ray Fisher) and Superman (Henry Cavill) to fight Steppenwolf in 'Justice League'.

The flick is slated to release on November 17.
