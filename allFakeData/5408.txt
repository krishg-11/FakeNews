The Voice coach has been spotted out with Gwen’s boys on numerous occasions, and it has them both thinking of having children together. “Mother’s Day was rough for Blake Shelton. He loves being close to Gwen and the bond he shares with her kids, but the day is a sad reminder to him that he never had kids of his own,” a source close to Blake tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY.
