Meet the two men in Kaley Cuoco's life

It would appear the Big Bang Theory's Kaley Cuoco is dipping her riding boot-encased-toe back into the dating pool.

On Friday, the 30-year-old actress posted a shot to Instagram showing her snuggling with Karl Cook, a fellow equestrian, captioned, "This is what happy looks like."

Cook, a 25-year-old up-and-coming pro rider who specializes in show jumping, began showing up her Instagram feed a few weeks ago.

But she hasn't forgotten her first love, Santos, her own show-jumping mount:

From a distance, the choice of a barn-friendly boyfriend is a wise first step after her divorce from tennis pro Ryan Sweeting. Cuoco and Cook have a major passion in common. Plus, the horse people know it never hurts to have someone who can pitch in with stall duty when you're away.

And who doesn't enjoy a man who looks good in riding breeches?
