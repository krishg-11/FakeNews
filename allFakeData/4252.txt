Aguilera and Bratman were married from November 2005 until October 2010, and, ironically, the couple finalized their divorce on Valentine’s Day 2011. They share custody of 6-year-old son Max Bratman.

“He’s the love of my life, and I adore him,” Aguilera gushed about Max on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in November 2010 shortly after the divorce news broke. “He’s such a character, and he’s so happy and at the end of the day, that’s what’s most important.”

Though The Voice coach is known for keeping her personal life private, Aguilera has posed with her new fiancé on several major red carpets, including the 2011 Golden Globes.

The couple has been living together in the Grammy-winning vocalist’s new Mulholland Estates mansion in Los Angeles, which she bought in April 2013 for $10 million.
