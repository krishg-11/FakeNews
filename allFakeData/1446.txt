JUST IN: John Kerry Facing Prison

Former Secretary of State John Kerry may be heading to prison after he was caught blatantly committing treason.

Right Wing News reported that in the weeks before President Donald Trump pulled out of the Iran deal, Kerry met with multiple Iranian leaders to try and save it. Jason Osborne, a former senior advisor to Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, took to Twitter to write about Kerry’s treasonous antics in Iran.

“So John Kerry just left a meeting @ L’Avenue in Paris w/3 Iranians. A friend was sitting next to their table and heard JK blasting @realDonaldTrump. The Iranians had a 5 person security detail and left in diplomatic vehicles. Is he FARA registered?” he tweeted.

One of the officials Kerry met with has since been identified as Kamal Kharzai, Iranian politician, and diplomat, as well as Iran’s Minister of Foreign Affairs from August 1997 until 2005.

Trump himself called Kerry out for this on Twitter, pointing out that he may have broken the law.

“The United States does not need John Kerry’s possibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy on the very badly negotiated Iran Deal. He was the one that created this MESS in the first place!” Trump tweeted.
