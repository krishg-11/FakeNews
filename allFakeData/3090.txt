Anne Hathaway Complains About Matthew McConaughey's Body Odor

Matthew McConaughey may be considered a heartthrob to many across the globe, but Anne Hathaway proved that he is definitely NOT her type. In fact, an insider claimed to OK! exclusively that she said he smells!

The A-listers both star in the upcoming thriller, Serenity, in which they play each other’s love interests—and the closer the two got, the farther away Anne tried to get! In fact, the source claimed she demanded protecting from his terrible odor: “She basically said, ‘Matthew, I love you, but you stink.’” Awkward!

The insider continued, “She convinced him to wash up before they filmed.” Coincidentally, that wasn’t even the first time the rugged star had ever heard that complaint. Kate Hudson, his co-star in Fools Gold, was also not feeling his stench. Now apparently used to rubbing his leading ladies the wrong way, Matthew was more than happy to accommodate with a solution. He “also let the crew burn incense on the set,” the source claimed. At least he was a good sport about it!

What do you think about Anne calling out Matthew’s terrible body odor on set? Sound off in the comments section!
