Kris Jenner 'planning to adopt a child with boyfriend Corey Gamble'

Kris Jenner is reportedly set to expand the Kardashian-Jenner brood with another child, this time of her own.

Jenner is already a mother six times over and a grandmother to eight beautiful infants, most recently welcoming Chicago and Stormi to the family.

But reports suggest that the famous Momager is looking to adopt a five-year-old boy with her boyfriend Corey Gamble.

A source told Closer Magazine: “Kris has been desperate for another child ever since her eldest daughter, Kourtney, gave birth to her first grandchild, Mason, eight years ago.

“Seeing so many of her own offspring have children has made her broody to have another.”

The insider continued: “Corey’s fallen in love with a five-year-old boy from an orphanage on the outskirts of LA.

“They’re in the process of having all the paperwork completed with the hope they might even be able to take their son home next month.”

Standard Online have contacted representatives for Jenner for comment.

Earlier this month, Jenner quipped that her “favourite child” changes every day but Khloé Kardashian – who is expecting her first child – was at the top of the list.

She told Australia’s KIIS 1065’s Kyle & Jackie O: “The last couple days it's been Khloe. She's on the favourite child list. Her and I have been bonding and shopping for the new baby.

“Well... it changes every day. Anybody who's a parent to a lot of kids knows... it depends on the day since there's a lot of dynamics in a mother/child relationship."
