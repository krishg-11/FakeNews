'CBS This Morning' wants Oprah to fill in for fired Charlie Rose: report

"CBS This Morning" is reportedly "begging" Oprah Winfrey to fill in for former co-host Charlie Rose, who was fired from the network after sexual harassment allegations.

“They are begging Oprah to fill in,” a source told Page Six. “Not full time ... But they are hoping she’ll do one day, two days, one hour, fill in ’til Christmas. Anything."

“Unless you get a superstar [on the show], it’s always going to be, ‘Charlie’s missing,'" an insider told the publication.

A CBS representative declined to comment to Page Six.

Earlier this year, Winfrey was hired by CBS to be a special contributor to "60 Minutes."

The Page Six report comes after The Washington Post reported earlier this week that eight women are accusing Rose of sexual misconduct. On Wednesday, a CBS report said three CBS employees had also accused Rose of sexual harassment.

CBS News and PBS fired Rose Tuesday in response to the allegations.

Rose said in a statement earlier this week he had behaved "insensitively" at times, but said some of the allegations against him were not accurate.

During Tuesday's broadcast of "CBS This Morning," co-host Norah O'Donnell said there's "no excuse" for Rose's behavior.

"This will be investigated. This has to end," she said. "This behavior is wrong. Period."

Co-host Gayle King also said Rose "does not get a pass here."
