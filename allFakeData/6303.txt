Queen Elizabeth II Travels in Style to Meet Prince Louis For the First Time

Queen Elizabeth II isn't like a regular great-grandmother, she's a cool great-grandmother. On Tuesday, the royal rode in style as she arrived at Kensington Palace by helicopter to meet her new great-grandson, Prince Louis, for the first time. Dressed casually with a scarf around her head, the queen gave the cameras a sly smile as she made her way to her car. She even had a bouquet of flowers, which were presumably a gift for new mom Kate Middleton.

The birth of Kate and Prince William's third child marks a very special moment for the royal family. Not only is Louis the 92-year-old royal's sixth great-grandchild, but the royal baby is now fifth in line to the throne, behind his sister Princess Charlotte. The Succession to the Crown Act made it so that female heirs would be guaranteed their spot in line, despite any male siblings born after them.
