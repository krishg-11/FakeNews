It was confirmed today that Emma Stone will take to the screen as Cruella de Vil, the puppy-hunting fashion villain from 101 Dalmatians, in the upcoming live-action film Cruella. While we don’t see Stone herself as the anti-puppy type, her casting comes as no surprise—not only because the actress has spent the better part of her career proving she can drive almost any film in a starring role, but also because we can already imagine her in that signature color-blocked bob.

Stone has never shied away from a scene-stealing dye job. Take 2009’s Zombieland, for which she dipped her natural blonde locks a dark chocolate. While she’s often thought of as a redhead, she’s actually only donned the fiery color for fun and film, trying everything from the warm cinnamon of Irrational Man to the auburn waves in Gangster Squad. Even as a blonde she’s left no shade unturned: The Help may be significant for those wild curls, but we’ll remember it for her pitch-perfect strawberry hue. Spiderman 2 saw her go paler still, but her part in Birdman took the peroxide even further with a shock of near-white layers. Now, as Cruella, she’ll wear both the visual equivalent of the absence of color and every single color at once. Above, a look at seven films that prove that if anyone is up for a hair-color challenge, it’s Emma Stone.
