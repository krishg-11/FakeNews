Karrueche Tran Manager Slams Chris Brown Attorney: Domestic Violence Is Real, Not Self-Promotion

That hearing, however, has never taken place because Tran has been unable to serve Brown with the original court order. Geragos could accept on his client’s behalf, but has refused. “I’m not here to help anybody increase their profile for self-promotion,” the lawyer told TMZ on Wednesday, further saying Tran was only going after Brown to “enhance” her “profile.” He insisted the model-actress’ allegations are untrue, and said her case against him is “doomed to failure.”

Tran’s manager York is now firing back. “Mark should put up or shut up, but this sleight of hand he’s trying to do, to distract from his client’s current violent issues, is reprehensible,” he tells Gossip Cop exclusively. York continues, “This is real life and real issues, and not a topic that should be used by Mark to spin press. Let them have their day in court and let the chips fall where they fall.”

As Gossip Cop previously noted, one of Tran’s friends also received a temporary restraining order against Brown in March, but has also been unable to face him in court. Most recently, just this week Brown was accused of punching a photographer at a nightclub in Florida. The photographer said he plans to press assault and battery charges. Geragos has not commented on that case.

UPDATE: Mark Geragos responded to this story with a tweet saying, “They can’t even serve CB with a lawsuit. Maybe they should ask their client to do it when she is following CB around the Country #teambreezy.”
