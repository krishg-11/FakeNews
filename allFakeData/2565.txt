Andy Samberg Mocks Justin Bieber in 'Popstar' Trailer

Andy Samberg is the new King of Pop in the first red band trailer for “Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping.”

In the film, Samberg plays hit musician Conner4Real, who faces a crisis of popularity after his sophomore album flops. His fans begin to then wonder if Conner is really as dope as he’s made himself out to be.

The mockumentary features an all-star comedy lineup that includes Sarah Silverman, Tim Meadows, Bill Hader and Maya Rudolph. In addition, celebrities like Usher, Simon Cowell, and Snoop Dogg will make cameos.
