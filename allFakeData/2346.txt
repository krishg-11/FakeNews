Flo Rida Not Performing At Donald Trump Inauguration, Despite Report

“Cashing In? Flo Rida Paid $1 Million To Perform At Trump Inauguration,” blares a new RadarOnline headline. The repeatedly discredited outlet goes on say, “A source close to rapper Flo Rida tells Radar he’s set to perform at the inauguration, and will even get $1 million for it!”

{"position1": {"artist": {"bio": "", "id": 58711, "name": "Flo Rida"}, "catalog_type": "artist", "description": "", "id": 58711, "name": "Flo Rida", "related": [{"bio": "", "id": 409834, "name": "Jason Derulo"}, {"bio": "", "id": 116313, "name": "The Black Eyed Peas"}, {"bio": "", "id": 40369, "name": "LMFAO"}, {"bio": "", "id": 28289, "name": "David Guetta"}, {"bio": "", "id": 34745, "name": "Sean Kingston"}, {"bio": "", "id": 42201, "name": "Pitbull"}, {"bio": "", "id": 43011, "name": "Taio Cruz"}], "tagged": false, "type": "catalog"}}

Flo Rida, however, is the same rapper that pulled out of performing at the 2015 Miss USA pageant after Trump made comments about Mexicans being “rapists.” The site notes this in its piece, but then alleges that the rapper has accepted the supposed $1 million offer because he has tax problems.

But Gossip Cop checked in with a rep for Flo Rida, who exclusively assures us the rapper simply won’t be performing at Trump’s inauguration, and this is a non-story. As of now, the only artists confirmed to be performing at the event later this month are “America’s Got Talent” contestant Jackie Evancho, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, and the Rockettes. Among the many musicians who have declined the offer to perform at the inauguration include Elton John, The Beach Boys, Charlotte Church, Andrea Bocelli, and David Foster.
