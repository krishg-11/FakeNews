Ian Somerhalder Threw Out Nikki Reed's Birth Control Pills

"To anyone who has been affected by the reproductive coercion, we are deeply sorry. That is an extremely serious issue, and women's rights is something that is incredibly important to both of us. It is something that is very close to our hearts. We never expected a lighthearted interview we do poking fun at EACH OTHER and how WE chose together to get pregnant, a goofy moment in Barcelona with our two best friends and the anticipation of the start of our journey together as we went from two to three, to turn into something representing a very serious matter."

The statement continues, "However, if this somehow sheds light on a topic that definitely needs mainstream attention, then we are grateful for the unintended consequence. IT's a shame that outlets chose this as their way into a very serious discussion, as we are certainly not qualified to be the faces of this topic. We are two happily married people who chose TOGETHER to have a baby. The end. Love, Nikki and Ian."
