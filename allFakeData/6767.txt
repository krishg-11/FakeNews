Are Mariah Carey & Joe Jonas Feuding?

Mariah Carey and Joe Jonas are NOT feuding, nor did she refuse to stand next to him as the ball dropped in Times Square on New Year’s Eve, despite a manufactured report. Gossip Cop can exclusively correct this claim. We’re told it’s “not true.”

“The Mariah-Joe Jonas Hate Fest Rolls On,” reads a headline in this week’s National Enquirer, which claims Carey “refused” to stand next to Jonas and his band in Times Square as the ball dropped on New Year’s Eve. A so-called “source” tells the tabloid, “Now Joe doesn’t want anything to do with Mariah or even be at the same events.”

Let Gossip Cop set the record straight. A rep for Carey exclusively assures us the report is 100 percent “not true.” The pair, who both performed in New York’s Times Square on New Year’s Eve, the busiest night of the year, weren’t standing anywhere near each other because there were roughly around 1 million people in between them. Once again, the supermarket tabloid has seemingly fabricated yet another imaginary feud.
