Khloé Kardashian and Kylie Jenner Have Diva Delivery Room Demands





A diva is the female version of a hustla…or maybe just a pregnant Kardashian-Jenner sister. Kylie Jenner and Khloé Kardashian — who both have babies on the way with their respective boyfriends, Travis Scott and Tristan Thompson — reportedly have crazy demands for their upcoming deliveries.

According to OK! Magazine, Kylie, 20, and Khloé, 33, are “already driving the staff at LA’s Cedars-Sinai hospital nuts.” While the Kylie Cosmetics founder has requested a completely stocked snack bar for her hospital room, KoKo is demanding that her room includes a brand-new bathtub in case she decides to have an underwater birth. On top of that, an insider tells the publication that both moms-to-be have decided that light gray, 1,000-thread count sheets are a necessity during their deliveries.

Though both Keeping Up With the Kardashians beauties have buns in the oven, neither have confirmed the exciting baby news themselves. However, it seems that both reality stars are looking forward to first-time motherhood.

“Tristan and I definitely talk about starting a family,” Khloé said on the last season of KUWTK. “[Tristan] wants to have five or six kids with me and that’s lovely. We could start at one and we could grow from there. But now knowing I’m not on birth control is just like — it’s scary. It’s like a really big step.”

For her part, Kylie has always wanted to have kids sooner than later. “I want kids for sure. I feel like seeing you guys go through everything, it’s great knowledge,” the lip kit queen said during a February 2016 episode of Kocktails With Khloé. “I feel like I want kids before I’m 30.”
