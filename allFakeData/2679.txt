Jamie Lynn Spears Talks First Pregnancy & Second Baby

Fans weren't the only ones shocked when Jamie Lynn Spears announced that she was pregnant in December 2007. Then 16, the Zoey 101 star retreated to her home state of Louisiana to raise Maddie, her daughter with ex-boyfriend Casey Aldridge. Now 22, Britney Spears' little sister opens up about her life as a mom and an aspiring country singer in an exclusive interview with E! News' Ken Baker.

"I was riding around in my mom's little convertible and I had not been feeling well. I thought it was just stress with work and all kinds of different things. My friend was like, 'Why don't you just take a test?' I was like, 'Okay, I will.' We were filling up with gas, so I went in the gas station and took the test and it was positive," she recalls. "So that is the glamorous way that I found out I was going to have my little nugget!"
