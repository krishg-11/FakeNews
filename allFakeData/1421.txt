CNN Shocks America, FIRES ‘Journalist’ Who Made Fun Of Sarah Sanders’ Face

On Sunday, CNN did something shocking: they took accountability for the actions of a member of their staff and kicked him to the curb over his remarks about Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

Marvin Schmidt, the now-former Saturday afternoon co-host of one of their programs, decided it would be fun to defend “comedian” Michelle Wolf’s disgusting attacks on the White House Press Secretary by further attacking her appearance far past her “smokey” eyes and alleged resemblance to The Handmaid’s Tale’s Aunt Lydia.

“Look at that face,” Schmidt said in a now-deleted tweet. “I mean, she’s a woman and I’m not supposed to say bad things but really folks, come on! Are we serious?”

In a statement provided to RedState, which recently fired a number of its staff for refusing to remain objective where President Trump is concerned, CNN explained:

We are forced to consider that in this terse political climate, we must fight to remain objective. What Marvin said was not in any way objective, and we do not in any way support attacking a woman’s looks no matter what one’s opinion of her is. We hope that this can help bridge the divide between the Left and Right, as we consider people of all political ideologies a vital and integral part of our audience.

While this is unlikely to convince any of us that CNN isn’t full of lies and misinformation, it’s good to see them do the right thing for once.
