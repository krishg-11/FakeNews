Katie Holmes and Joshua Jackson looked VERY lovey dovey at that 'Dawson's Creek' reunion

Joey Potter and Pacey Witter still look crazy in love, and Dawson's Creek fans are overjoyed to the point of tears.

The cast of the teen drama recently reunited to celebrate the show's 20th anniversary for a special edition of Entertainment Weekly. After reviewing the flawless photoshoot one thing stood out: Katie Holmes and Joshua Jackson looking truly, madly, and deeply in love.

Holmes and Jackson played Joey and Pacey, respectively, one of the show's greatest ships, so to see them lovingly touching each other like time had damn near frozen in 2003 was A LOT to handle.

Perceptive fans immediately picked up on the chemistry between the two actors and it was as if the rest of the cast wasn't even there.

I still love them üòç #DawsonsCreek

I mean, look at Holmes resting her hands on Jackson's shoulders.

And then Jackson RESTED HIS HEAD on Holmes' shoulder and put his hand on her back. Are you kidding me?

I thought I was over my high school obsession with #DawsonsCreek ... then I saw this GIF of Pacey & Joey and my heart exploded.pic.twitter.com/IXVdeZORza ‚Äî Bianca Posterli üå¥ (@Bincerli) March 28, 2018

They even wore the same hat and it was all just very overwhelming, okay?!!

I love that EW had Katie Holmes and Joshua Jackson wearing the same hat in their solo covers to further cement the forever love of Joey and Pacey. #DawsonsCreek pic.twitter.com/1x1rVS62w2 ‚Äî Hanna Ines Flint (@HannaFlint) March 28, 2018
