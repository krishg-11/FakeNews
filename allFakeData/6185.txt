Selena Gomez Debuted A New Look on the AMA Red Carpet and Fans Are 'Shook'

Selena Gomez showed up to the American Music Awards red carpet saying, "New look, who dis?"

The "Wolves" singer debuted a platinum blonde hairstyle on Sunday night, pairing the look with a rocking black leather mini dress, and fans on Twitter have a lot of opinions.

Gomez will perform for the first time in over a year during the award show, her first performance since her kidney transplant earlier this year.

While most fans agree that she looks hotter than ever, the look has also drawn comparisons to on-again boyfriend Justin Bieber. Here's what they're saying so far:
