AceShowbiz - %cCeline Dion% reportedly has a "titanic crush" on %cDavid Foster%. According to a latest report from Star, the 48-year-old singer's "heart is ready to go on with her late husband's [Rene Angelil] friend David Foster," who was also her collaborator on "The Power of Love" and "Because You Love Me".

The magazine quotes a so-called source close to Celine as saying, "David and Celine have been close for 25 years; He's like family." But it goes on claiming, "Celine may be too deep in the friend zone to have a shot with the music mogul," noting that David recently divorced %cYolanda Hadid% and is currently with %cChristie Brinkley%.

"He's been in constant contact with Celine since Rene passed away, but he sees her as a friend, not a lover," the alleged source reveals to the news outlet. "When we bring it up, she blushes and says, 'I love David, but he only dates supermodels,' " the insider adds.

While both Celine and David have yet to give any comment regarding the report, a friend of the "My Heart Will Go On" hitmaker has shot it down, telling Gossip Cop that the above claim is "ridiculous." The fact is Celine doesn't have a crush on David and is not "too deep in the friend zone to have shot" with the 67-year-old music mogul.
