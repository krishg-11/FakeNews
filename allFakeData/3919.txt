Debunking the week's tabloid stories: June 8, 2018

|

The new cover of Life & Style announces, "George & Amal Divorce Bombshell... With A Baby On The Way!" According to the outlet, Amal Clooney is pregnant with her third child, but is in a "broken relationship" with George Clooney.

Because their "relationship recently has been plagued by clashes over his feelings of suffocation and her jealousy," the "timing isn't exactly ideal" for another kid, explains the publication. A source also relates, "Friends have wondered about the possibility of divorce more than once, but they're hopeful that having another child will bring them back together."

But after maintaining the couple "can't stop fighting over everything from other women to his need for freedom," the magazine ultimately admits towards the end of the story that the couple is not actually breaking up, because "both believe their marriage is worth saving." Asserts the tipster, "George and Amal have way too much going for them to split."

Gossip Cop can explain what's really going on: The Clooneys are neither expecting again nor on the brink of a breakup. The tabloid manufactured a deceptive cover story to lure in readers with sensational lies. Both George and Amal have said on the record that they are done having kids. And just last week, they gushed over each other and showed PDA at an AFI gala held in the actor's honor. There is no "divorce bombshell."
