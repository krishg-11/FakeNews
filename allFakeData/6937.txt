New fashion statement? As she was sitting front row at her father Kanye West’s Adidas New York Fashion Week collection on Thursday, Feb. 12, 20-month-old North West was wearing a bulletproof vest from her dad’s line.

The image featured little Nori wearing the black vest, strapped on by velcro as she made a silly face.

Kimye’s tiny tot has made several noteworthy Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week appearances, first throwing a fit at her dad’s show while nestled in the front row between Vogue’s Anna Wintour and Beyonce and Jay Z.

She then sat front row at the Alexander Wang show on Feb. 14, supporting her aunt Kendall Jenner, who walked in the show. Nori got upset and started crying when she spotted a photographer with a plush monkey toy around his camera lens, but later recovered when he let her play with the toy backstage.
