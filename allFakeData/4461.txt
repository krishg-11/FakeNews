Oprah Winfrey Reveals Why She Won't Marry Stedman Graham

The couple has been dating for 31 years.

Oprah Winfrey and longtime partner Stedman Graham have been going steady for 31 years, but don't expect any wedding bells soon. Or ever.

The media mogul revealed in an interview with Vogue that not getting married has taught her to "live life on your own terms," she said. Despite having dated for so long, Winfrey shared that the duo have only discussed marriage once. "The only time I brought it up was when I said to Stedman, 'What would have happened if we had actually gotten married?' And the answer is: 'We wouldn’t be together.' "

She continued to explain that "marriage requires a different way of being in this world." The talk show host added that she wouldn't have fit into what she viewed as a "traditional" role.

Last year, it was rumored that Winfrey and Graham said "I do." However, Winfrey took to Twitter to set the record straight.

6 people who know me well have called today congratulating me or surprised they weren't invited to my wedding.

IT' s NOT TRUE!! — Oprah Winfrey (@Oprah) September 5, 2016

According to Today, there was a time when Winfrey wanted her other half to marry her.

"I wanted Stedman to want to marry me. The moment he asked me to marry him I was, like... 'Now I actually have to get married?' " she revealed to Shonda Rhimes in a 2015 episode of SuperSoul Sunday. Graham proposed more than 20 years ago and the wedding was supposed to take place in 1993, but Winfrey was working on a book at the same time, so they decided to postpone it. "We have never discussed it again," she told Rhimes.
