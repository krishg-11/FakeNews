"That '70s Show," a comedy about a group of teenage friends growing up in 1970s Wisconsin, ran from 1998-2006. The Fox hit also starred Laura Prepon, Mila Kunis, and Topher Grace.

Although 37-year-old Topher didn't appear to be present at the mini reunion, he did have nothing but good things to say about his former co-stars -- particularly the now-married Ashton and Mila -- when ET caught up with him in August. The superstar couple first met on the set of "That 70's Show" but didn't begin dating until April 2012. Last October, the happy couple welcomed their now one-year-old daughter Wyatt.

"They are both amazing people so the fact that they're together now and have a kid, it's like your two great friends from high school got together after high school," Topher happily told ET at the Hollywood Foreign Press Association's Grants Banquet.
