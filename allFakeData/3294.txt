Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban's marriage back on track

They’ve been hit by a series of break-up rumours, but it looks like Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban are more in love than ever!

Proving that their marriage is well and truly back on track, Nicole surprised Keith by joining him on stage for a touching duet during the Spotify Fans First event in Nashville last week.

People reported that the 50-year-old Aussie actress interrupted Keith from backstage, and when he recognised her voice, he called her up saying: ‘You can come and sing it with me.’ The pair then sang the romantic ballad together, with Keith later sharing a clip of the performance on Instagram.
