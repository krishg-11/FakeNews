Prince William and Kate Middleton May Not Live at Kensington Palace Forever

Prince William knows the pressures of growing up in the spotlight, and he’s hoping to lessen those for his 3-year-old son George. In an interview with British GQ, the Duke of Cambridge opened up about his familial ideals.

Prince William chatted with reporter Alastair Campbell in his comfortable study, surrounded by neutral tones and pops of tomato red. "I could not do my job without the stability of the family,” he said of wife Kate Middleton, son George and 2-year-old daughter Charlotte. “Stability at home is so important to me. I want to bring up my children in a happy, stable, secure world and that is so important to both of us as parents.”

Speaking specifically about his son, the future King of England Prince William explains: "I want George to grow up in a real, living environment; I don’t want him growing up behind palace walls, he has to be out there. The media makes it harder, but I will fight for them to have a normal life." An additional image of Prince George accompanies the interview, in which the young royal is shown chasing his younger sister outside the grounds of Kensington Palace as his parents look on.

For now, Kate Middleton and Prince William live between a country manor in Norfolk known as Anmer Hall and London’s Kensington Palace. Prince Harry lives in Kensington Palace as well; the couple moved there after they were wed.
