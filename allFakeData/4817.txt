Miley Cyrus Has No Plan To Leave The Country In The Era Of Trump

I still think that in her lifetime [Hillary Clinton] deserves to be the first female president and that’s what makes me so sad. I just wish she had that opportunity because she’s fought for so long and because I believe her when she says she loves this country. This is all she’s ever done. She’s given her life to make it better ... Happy Hippies, we adjust and accept everyone. And so Donald Trump, I accept you. And this hurts to say, but I even accept you as a president of the United States. And that’s fine. That’s fine, because I think now I want to be a hopeful hippie.
