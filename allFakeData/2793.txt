Angelina Jolie Ordered to Repair Relationship Between Her Kids & Their Dad, Brad Pitt

Brad Pitt will be getting visitation time with his children this summer as a judge has ordered Angelina Jolie to repair his relationship with their six kids.

A judge in the former couple’s divorce case says that the children “not having a relationship with their father is harmful to them” and “it is critical that each of them have a healthy and strong relationship with their father and mother,” according to The Blast.

Angelina must give Brad the cell phone numbers for each child and he is allowed to call them whenever he wants. She is not allowed to read text messages between him and the children. She also must arrange a call between the kids and their doctors so it can be explained to them that “the court has determined that each of them are safe with their father.”

A visitation schedule has been laid out for Brad to spend time with the kids – Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and nine-year-old twins Vivienne and Knox – while they are in London, where Angelina is shooting Maleficent 2.

Because Maddox is older, he will get to decide how much time he spends with his father.

If Angelina does not allow her children to spend more time with Brad, she may lose primary custody. The judge said, “If the minor children remain closed down to their father and depending on the circumstances surrounding this condition, it may result in a reduction of the time they spend with [Jolie] and may result in the Court ordering primary physical custody to [Pitt].”
