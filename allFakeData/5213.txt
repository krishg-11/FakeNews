The latest issue of Woman’s Day says Aniston and Jolie have spent the past decade avoiding each other, but both agreed to attended Witherspoon’s 42nd birthday party last month. According to a so-called “source,” it was Witherspoon’s idea to bury the hatchet between the two. “For years, Reese has had to delicately balance the friendships and it hasn’t been easy at times,” says the supposed insider. “But she decided enough was enough and encouraged both of them to attend.”



The outlet’s questionable tipster goes on to say that Aniston approached Jolie first, and when she did so, “everyone in the room was suddenly aware of what was going on and you could feel the tension.” As the story goes, the conversation turned out to be “extremely courteous and civil.” The “insider” says Brad Pitt’s name was never mentioned, but Jolie did tell Aniston “she was sorry to hear of her split” from Justin Theroux.



The seemingly phony tipster concludes, “Reese was so proud of them for being so mature and poised. She had been secretly worried that having them both there could ruin her evening, but it all went amazingly well.” But while the magazine hides behind an untraceable “source,” Aniston’s spokesperson tells Gossip Cop on the record that the tabloid’s story is “made-up.” In fact, there’s nothing to indicate that Witherspoon even had a birthday bash this year. It has made headlines in past years when the actress would celebrate her birthday with famous friends, but no such party was reported this year.
