Robert Pattinson and FKA twigs Might Not Marry After All

Some sad news in celebrity wedding land: Robert Pattinson and FKA twigs's upcoming nuptials have been canceled, according to an In Touch report. The tabloid says that Rob called off the summer wedding, quoting an insider who says "it's been a long time coming" and that the couple was "fighting all the time." The same source adds that "Rob felt trapped" and the wedding plans were not helping. And then there's this:

Furthermore, FKA twigs wasn't the girl Robert thought she was â€” and her true colors eventually came to light during their wedding planning. "[She] isn't the girl for him. She's very jealous and he was sick of having to explain himself," the insider added. "He's still young and just decided he wasn't ready to settle down."

As with anything from In Touch, do take this with a grain of salt. For all you know, Rob and FKA are happily walking around a beach somewhere, laughing over this rumor, sipping wine, and looking beautiful. In fact, the folks at Gossip Cop are saying the report is false after checking in with a source "close to the situation."

Handsome Rob and FKA's engagement made headlines approximately one year ago when T-Pain accidentally revealed the news to Vulture. It was later confirmed by two sources to People and well, this is the ring, apparently:

Rob and FKA have not been spotted in public since last November's GO Campaign Gala in Beverly Hills but then again, their relationship has been generally private this whole time.
