Rachel Weisz Splits With Darren Aronofskyâ€”Does Daniel Craig Figure In?

Despite being together since 2001, engaged since 2005 and having a 4-year-old son, Henry, Weisz had long admitted to being shy about pulling the trigger on marriage.

"Funnily enough, just recently I suddenly felt like I really would like to get married," Weisz said during an appearance on The View last January. "It's just a feeling. I know it's a funny thing."

Weisz had also gushed to Redbook last year that she and the Wrestler filmmaker were committed "until death do us part" although no official vows had been exchanged.

Somewhere along the line things changed.

Notably, there have been rumors about Weisz and Daniel Craig. She and the 007 star allegedly did some serious Bond-ing while working on the film Dream House earlier this year, though neither has confirmed any romance.

As for Aronofsky and Weisz, the couple had been planning to reteam (they previously worked together on 2005's sci-fi flick The Fountain) on a biopic of Jackie Kennedy, but that project no longer is listed on either's IMDb credits.

The couple plan to share custody of Henry and continue to raise him in New York.
