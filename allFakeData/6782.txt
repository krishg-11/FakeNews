Miranda Kerr Is Pregnant Again!





Congratulations are in order for Miranda Kerr. The supermodel announced on Wednesday, November 15, that she is expecting a baby with her husband of six months, Evan Spiegel.

This will be the second child for the 34-year-old, who shares custody of son, Flynn, 6, with her ex-husband, Orlando Bloom.

“Miranda, Evan and Flynn are looking forward to welcoming the newest member of their family,” a spokesperson tells Us Weekly.

Kerr and the Snapchat founder, 27, were married at their home in Los Angeles’ Brentwood neighborhood on May 27. They couple announced their engagement in July 2016 when she shared a photo of her diamond ring alongside a custom “Marry Me” Snapchat filter. “I said yes!!!” wrote the former Victoria’s Secret Angel on Instagram.

Despite the age difference between the spouses, Kerr has gushed about Spiegel’s maturity. “He’s not out partying. He goes to work in [L.A.’s] Venice,” she told The Edit in 2016. “He comes home early. We don’t go out. We’d rather be at home and have dinner, go to bed early.”

Kerr once said that parenting Flynn is “the most rewarding thing” she’s ever done. “It has taught me so much about patience and unconditional love,” she told Harper’s Bazaar. “Being a working mother is challenging because . . . I never want to leave him — but it’s important to teach your child the value of working.”
