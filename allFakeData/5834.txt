She's all mine! Ellen DeGeneres beams as wife Portia de Rossi shows off her svelte figure in black frock at premiere party



Ellen DeGeneres was so proud of Portia de Rossi and small wonder.

Portia was looking radiant from head to heels as she attended the Arrested Development season four premiere in Los Angeles on the arm of her talk show partner.

The slender 40-year-old was wearing a sleek-fitting, long-sleeved black brocade dress with sheer cut-a-way details on the sides and back.

Glamorous: Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi were arm in arm at the Arrested Development season four premiere in Los Angeles on Monday

The hemline stopped short of her knees to reveal shapely calves and slim ankles, and there were black pointed heels on her feet.

Portia wore her light blonde hair short and spiked on top, which added even more height to her five-foot-seven inches.

The former Ally McBeal star has always tended to be the girly one of the couple and proved that point again on this occasion.

Arresting: Portia, who stars on the comedy Arrested Development, wowed the crowd and Ellen in this clingy black number with sheer cut-a-way details on the sides and back

Sheer wonder: The back of Portia's dress featured a dazzling sheer panel

Hands on: Ellen seemed so proud of Portia, who bent her head down in a sudden show of modesty

Ellen's classy and more masculine look complimented Portia's feminine outfit perfectly.

The 55-year-old television host was clad in a grey suit with black and white striped knit top, and grey suede shoes completed the picture.

They've been married five years - and together a total of eight - and they still seemed more in tune than ever.

Portia revealed in a recent interview in Out magazine that she and Ellen have no plans to start a family.

Instead they are parents to a household full of rescued dogs and cats.

The couple posed hand in hand and then arm in arm, and at one point Ellen let Portia stand for a few solo pictures.
