Troubled “Happy Days” actress Erin Moran died of a suspected heroin overdose, according to a published report on Sunday.

Cops found Moran, who played Joanie Cunningham on the iconic sitcom, unconscious in New Salisbury, Indiana, on Saturday before she was pronounced dead.

It’s believed she died of an heroin OD, the Daily Mail reported.

Harrison County Sheriff’s deputies declined comment on Sunday, only saying that they got a 911 call at 4:07 p.m. on Saturday and found an unresponsive Moran.

“It was determined that Erin Marie Moran Fleischmann was deceased. An autopsy is pending,” according to a sheriff’s statement.

Moran was 56.

“May people remember Eric for her contagious smile, warm heart, and animal loving soul,” her “Joanie Love Chachi” co-star Scott Baio tweeted on Sunday.

“I always hoped she could find peace in her life. God has you now, Erin.”

Moran’s “Happy Days” mom, Marion Ross, also said Sunday she wished to remember the child star in happier times.

“This breaks my heart,” Moran’s TV mom Ross, 88, told NBC in Los Angeles. “She was the quickest, fastest little kid. Wonderful.”

Moran is the third regular cast member of the show to die since “Happy Days” went off the air in 1984 — following TV dad Tom Bosley (2010) and Arnold’s owners Al Molinaro (2015) and Pat Morita (2005).
