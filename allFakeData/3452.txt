Terrell Owens joins 'Dancing With the Stars'

If you've ever wanted to see former NFL star Terrell Owens do the tango, this may be your chance. The six-time Pro-Bowler is the first contestant announced to be joining season 25 of Dancing with the Stars.

Owens will be accompanied by Cheryl Burke, who has previously been partnered up with Chad 'Ochocinco' Johnson and Emmitt Smith.

"If I can handle [Dallas Cowboys Coach] Bill Parcells, then I can handle Cheryl," Owens told Good Morning America. "It's going to be a challenge. Yesterday we got our first start at trying to learn some steps, so that's the challenge."

Owens, whose 15-year career in the NFL has included time with the Philadelphia Eagles, Dallas Cowboys, and San Francisco 49ers, says that he reached out to Ochocinco for advice on joining the dance competition.

"He said it's going to be a lot of work but I expect nothing different," Owens said. "This is going to be a challenge for me, definitely. [It's] definitely not in my wheelhouse. I danced as a little kid but this is nothing like what I'm going to expect, I'm sure."

Dancing with the Stars Season 25 premieres on September 18.
