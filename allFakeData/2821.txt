Brad Pitt's mom wants him to get back with Jennifer Aniston

Brad Pitt‘s family – particularly his mom Jane – is thrilled he’s back in touch with Jennifer Aniston following her split from Justin Theroux, according to RadarOnline.com.

“This is what she’s dreamed of for over a decade — she never lost faith and has stayed in touch with Jen for years,” says a source.

What’s more — the informant reveals both Aniston and Jane “are both pretty old school and write long letters to each other a couple of times a month.” Plus, they talk on the phone regularly and never miss a birthday or anniversary.

“Jane and the whole Missouri-based Pitt family haven’t been disrespectful about Jen and Justin’s marriage, but once it became apparent things wouldn’t work out they actively pushed Brad to get back in touch” dishes the snitch. “Now they’re determined to see them back together for a second chance.”

As fans know, Pitt famously left wife Aniston for Angelina Jolie. They later wed but also split up.

But Aniston reportedly leaned on her ex-husband Brad over the course of 15 months as her ­marriage to Justin Theroux crumbled.

Aniston and Theroux announced their breakup on Feb. 15, 2018 after only two-and-a-half years of marriage.

The announcement read, in part, “In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation. This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year.

“We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship….Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.”

Radar told you first that Aniston and Theroux were breaking up and detailed their many issues.
