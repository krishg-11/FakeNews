Blake Shelton Booze Liquor Store Photo -- Gwen Stefani Ordered Him To Stop Drinking Before Wedding

Boozy Blake Back On The Bottle — After Gwen Made Him Quit! Shelton was caught stocking up on spirits while Stefani was out of town.

‚I do … want another drink? Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton’s wedding plans could be on hold, RadarOnline.com has learned, after the No Doubt front woman asked her fiance to put down the bottle — and he headed to the liquor store!

Shelton recently dropped 85 pounds on Stefani’s no-booze wedding diet, according to an insider. But then, late last month, he was caught leaving an L.A. liquor store with enough swill to soak Skid Row for a month.

What’s more, the bad boy launched his booze-buying spree just hours after Stefani, 47, chatted it up with late-night TV host Seth Meyers 2,500 miles away in New York City!

“When Gwen is away, Blake seems to play! Or, at the very least, take a few cheat days,” a source told Radar.

Shelton’s box bulged with multiple bottles of tequila, and was packed so tightly that even the burly 40-year-old struggled to carry it only a few feet to his car!

As Radar has reported, the country stud has long loved the lush life. Stefani proved to be a calming influence after they hooked up in November 2015, but the source said that Shelton is ready to get rowdy again.

Said one insider, “The wedding can’t come soon enough for Blake!”
