The 32-year-old is in Europe ahead of the Venice Film Festival, which kicked off on Wednesday.

Her new movie, A Star Is Born, will premiere there tomorrow.

In the first photo, shot by photographer Eli Russell Linnetz, the superstar is flashing her tattoos as she seductively rolls up her tights.

The second photo sees her posing against a wall as she stares moodily into the lens, while in the third shot she is standing with her slim profile to camera.

Since August 15, the singer has posted 18 pictures, including a series of distorted black and white snaps, shot by Linnetz, who has worked extensively with Kanye West in the past.

After taking a break from music, Golden Globe-winner Gaga has clearly been busy modelling and will also star in her first big film role in Bradley Cooper's directorial debut, A Star Is Born, out in October.
