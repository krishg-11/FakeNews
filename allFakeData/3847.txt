Donald Trump hit back against Meryl Streep on Monday morning, following the actress‚Äô impassioned speech at Sunday‚Äôs Golden Globes, which took the president-elect to task for mocking a New York Times reporter for his disability. ‚ÄúMeryl Streep, one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood, doesn‚Äôt know me but attacked last night at the Golden Globes,‚Äù Trump wrote on Twitter. ‚ÄúShe is a Hillary flunky who lost big. For the 100th time, I never ‚Äòmocked‚Äô a disabled reporter (would never do that) but simply showed him ‚Äògroveling‚Äô when he totally changed a 16-year-old story that he had written in order to make me look bad. Just more very dishonest media!‚Äù

Streep is one of the most lauded actresses of all-time, with 30 Golden Globes nominations and 19 Oscar nominations, and is one of only six people ever to win three or more acting honors at the Academy Awards. She‚Äôs also not the first person the president-elect has called ‚Äúover-rated‚Äù on Twitter since 2012. Ahead, a complete list ‚Äî including Streep, President Barack Obama, Jon Stewart, and the cast of Hamilton.
