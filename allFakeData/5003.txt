Sofia Richie Is Copying Kourtney Kardashian's Whole Life (EXCLUSIVE)

Model Sofia Richie is keeping up with the Kardashians… at least one of them. Ever since she started dating Scott Disick last year, the 19-year-old has seemingly morphed into his longtime ex Kourtney Kardashian, 38. Sofia wears similar clothes. She dyed her blond hair dark brown. She’s been spotted out with Scott’s kids. Did we mention she dyed her hair dark brown?! Don’t think for a second that this is all a coincident!

“Sofia wants to be Kourtney 2.0,” an insider tells In Touch exclusively. “She’s determined to hold on to Scott. What better way to do that than to become the woman he’ll never stop loving?” That may sound totally weird, but Scott, 34, is actually into it, according to the source. She’s willing to stop at nothing to make this happen, including dressing like the reality star. “It’s like she raided Kourt’s closet!”

“Of course, there’s one person who finds it completely immature and laughable: Kourtney,” continued the insider. How could you blame her? However, it sounds like Kourtney is taking the high road and not causing any drama over it. “She likes Sofia — she really has nothing against her — but she does think of her as a kid, a teenager, which she is.”

One thing Kourtney isn’t okay with is the fact that her baby daddy’s teen girlfriend is trying to play mommy to her three kids. “[Kourtney] doesn’t love that Sofia is spending time with her kids,” says an insider. Let’s hope Sofia gives the mom enough space to avoid some major drama!
