Nicole Kidman is helping Isabella Cruise adopt a child, report

Nicole Kidman, who went through the adoption process in the 1990s when she and then-husband Tom Cruise adopted son Connor and daughter Isabella, is now helping Isabella with the same process, In Touch reports.

'Isabella has her heart set on giving a child a chance like she had,' a source told In Touch. 'Nicole has been pivotal in the process, pouring her energy into supporting Isabella and Max [Parker, her husband].'

Kidman, who once said 'to stay in touch with [Isabella and Connor] is very important, reportedly paid for Isabell and Max to receive pre-adoption therapy and even sprung for a new five-bedroom home for the 25-year-old.

The 50-year-old actress is set to go to London, where Isabella and Max live, to help them navigate the process, says a source.
