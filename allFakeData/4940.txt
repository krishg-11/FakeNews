That '70s Show (TV Series 1998â€“2006)

Eric Forman is a typical high school student growing up in Wisconsin in 1976 with his family and his friends. Together, they have the same kind of joys and sorrows that just about every teenager has while growing up. This show parodied many of the attitudes, events and fads of the 70s, along with those who grew up at the time. Written by Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net>
