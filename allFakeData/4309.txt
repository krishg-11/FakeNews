Jennifer Lopez has not one but two hot dates for brunch in Miami

Jennifer Lopez had not one but two handsome brunch dates. On Friday, May 4, the World of Dance judge dined with boyfriend Alex Rodriguez and her ex-husband Marc Anthony. The trio enjoyed breakfast at Miami hot spot Greenstreet Cafe in the Coconut Grove area. The trio kept their outing low key, with the help of two bodyguards. The group also kept their meal healthy – munching on some of the eatery’s prime dishes including, egg whites, egg white veggie omelettes, the spinach and feta omelette, turkey bacon and avocado. After their meal, Jennifer and Alex left together, while the Vivir Mi Vida singer left in a separate car.
