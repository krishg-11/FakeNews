Jamie Foxx & Katie Holmes Flaunt Their 5-Year Romance With Cute Beach Romp

The public has been somewhat aware of the Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes romantic link for a little while now. Though we've seen them spending time together, the pair hasn't offered any obvious public displays of affection until now.

Foxx and Holmes were spotted having a romantic time at the beach. Onlookers watched them wrestle in the sand and share a bottle of champagne in between make-out sessions. One of the beachgoers dished about how happy they seemed:

"They were totally engaged with each other. They were never on their phones. She had this incredible smile on her face. She looked smitten."

Sources close to Holmes have commented on the lovers' connection. One spoke of their discretion.

“Katie and Jamie care about each other a lot and they tried to stay as quiet as possible because they didn’t want to ruin that. They knew the second they stepped out together, it would open the gates for criticism.”

Another spoke of Katie's friend's reservations concerning her romantic choice.

“No one can understand why Katie loves a man who can’t seem to commit. Everyone wants Katie to take care of herself.”

In a way, this display doesn't come as much of a surprise considering the fact that their relationship has been ongoing for 5 years. Apparently, the secretive nature of their relationship was due to a clause in Katie's divorce agreement with Tom Cruise. She agreed to keep her next relationship under wraps for 5 years following the divorce. In exchange, she received $11.4 million for her discretion.
