Taylor Swift Madly in Love With Joe Alwyn and Privacy

Bless Joe Alwyn for teaching Taylor Swift the value of keeping her personal life private, Us Weekly enthusiastically reports, because her happiness these days is unparalleled! The tabloid got a detailed report on how madly in love Swift is with Alwyn's and her secret(ish) relationship.

“Joe has really showed her a different lifestyle and the value of privacy,” a source told the outlet. “She’s the happiest she’s ever been.”

This shift has drastically improved Swift's life, a source added. “Taylor is so much happier without her personal life in the open. She credits Joe for that and realizes how much better off she is.”

Swift, for one of the first times in the public eye, has not talked about Alwyn in any interviews. She has barely been photographed out with him, though this week they were shot holding hands in Turks and Caicos. “They seemed genuinely happy,” a witness there told Us of their interactions out and about there. “They were always smiling and close to each other, but kept to themselves.”

Swift isn't about to say anything about Alwyn though, another source cautioned the outlet. The couple “vowed to keep their relationship to themselves. They’ve done everything they can to keep it that way.”
