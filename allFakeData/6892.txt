As Star reported, the pair got back together after a blowout fight that led to their breakup earlier this year in April.

But rumors started to swirl that they were hooking back up after the 47-year-old diva posted a selfie with her boytoy, 34, on May 20. Just two weeks later, they were seen all over each other on a dinner date.
