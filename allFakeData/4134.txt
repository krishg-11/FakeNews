This is the first child for Jen and her husband, Justin Theroux.

“She’s pregnant,” a friend of the couple tells In Touch. “She and Justin are ecstatic. Jen has wanted to have a baby with Justin for years. Their baby news came at a bad time in her life, too — she just lost her mother, and she and Justin almost broke up. But now this surprise pregnancy has turned the worst of times into the best of times.”

Congrats!
