Khloe Kardashian wants her daughter True to marry Prince George - report

Khloe Kardashian wants her baby daughter True to follow in fellow American Meghan Markle's footsteps and marry an actual prince, according to reports.

The reality TV star gave birth last month as multiple videos seemingly showing the infant's father, Tristan Thompson, cheating with various women were published online.

An unnamed source 'close to the Kardashian family' has now told gossip publication HollywoodLife that Khloe dreams of True one day being wed to Prince George, the four-year-old son of royals William and Kate.

"Khloe thinks Meghan and Harry's love story is incredibly inspirational," HollywoodLife quotes its source as saying.

"Khloe thinks it would be amazing for one of the Kardashian girls to be the future Queen, and it would be the perfect combination of British and American royalty. If Meghan can become a member of the British royal family, then Khloe doesn't see why her daughter can't."

Meanwhile, Khloe's older sister Kim tweeted a message of heart-eyed emojis about Meghan and Harry's wedding, which took place on Saturday.
