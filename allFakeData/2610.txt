Trouble in paradise? Ex-Yankee Alex Rodriguez, Jennifer Lopez wedding on the rocks, report says

The Alex Rodriguez-Jennifer Lopez relationship has hit a snag.

With an impending marriage on the horizon, Lopez reportedly has started to have cold feet about marrying the former Yankees star, per TerezOwens.com.

Jennifer Lopez has put her plans to wed Alex Rodriguez on hold, an insider exclusively tells Life & Style. According to the source, the pop superstar, 47, is getting cold feet. "Jennifer keeps telling Alex that she's 'just not there yet,'" says the insider.

According to the report, Rodriguez has been pushing for a date.

"A-Rod has been begging J.Lo to set a wedding date. She loves him, but she's told him that until she says otherwise, the wedding is on hold."

The two celebrities have been talked about as one of the biggest power couples over the past year.

Months ago, a report suggested Lopez--not Rodriguez--wanted the marriage to happen by the end of 2017.

According to a report from In Touch, Rodriguez and Lopez are discussing a prenuptial agreement in preparation for marriage. The highly successful celebrities both have children from previous relationships and hundreds of millions of dollars to call their own before marriage.

Things are getting serious!

Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez's relationship began just a couple months ago, but that hasn't stopped them from talking marriage. And, in Hollywood, when a couple is talking marriage, it goes without saying that they're talking prenups!

The 47-year-old and her 41-year-old beau, "have been talking about a prenuptial agreement," an insider revealed to In Touch.

Now the relationship could be ending.
