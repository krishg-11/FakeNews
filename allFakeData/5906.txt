Caitlyn Jenner to Publish a Memoir About Her Transformation

Caitlyn Jenner — the reality TV star and prominent transgender activist — will publish a memoir about her highly public transformation from the Olympic track star and motivational speaker Bruce Jenner into a glamorous transgender woman, Caitlyn Marie Jenner.

Ms. Jenner will write the memoir with Buzz Bissinger, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author of “Friday Night Lights,” the 1990 nonfiction book about a Texas high school football team that inspired a film and television series. Grand Central Publishing is tentatively scheduled to release the Jenner book in the spring of 2017.

Rumors have swirled about a possible book deal for Ms. Jenner since last April, when she announced that she was becoming a woman during an interview with Diane Sawyer that drew nearly 17 million viewers.

The interview was followed by a Vanity Fair cover story, written by Mr. Bissinger, in which Ms. Jenner revealed her new identity as Caitlyn, and described her decades-long struggle with gender dysphoria. The flurry of publicity culminated in the premiere of a documentary series on E!, “I Am Cait,” which will begin its second season this March, about Ms. Jenner’s new public life as a woman.
