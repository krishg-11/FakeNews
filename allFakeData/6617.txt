Caitlyn Jenner joins 'girlfriend' Sophia Hutchins at Kylie's birthday

Caitlyn Jenner stepped out alongside her close pal and rumoured 'girlfriend' Sophia Hutchins to celebrate her daughter Kylie's 21st birthday in West Hollywood on Thursday.

The Kardashian-Jenner clan headed to hotspot Craig's to mark the mother-of-one's milestone birthday, with Caitlyn choosing to bring along Sophia, 22, for the festivities.

The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star, 68, made sure she was dressed for the occasion and slipped into a sequinned mini dress and suede court heels, while toting the same Gucci handbag as her ex Kris Jenner.

Her glittering ensemble nipped in at the waist, drawing attention to Caitlyn's curvaceous frame, and the former athletics star ensured her beauty look matched up to her stand-out outfit.

She wore her caramel-hued locks down in loose curls, parted in the middle, and completed her look with stunning make-up that boasted a dramatic eye and nude lip.

Caitlyn was seen arriving to the popular eatery with Sophia in tow, with the blonde beauty turning heads in a thigh-skimming mini dress that sheathed her slender frame.

Sophia elongated her honed pins in a pair of studded black strappy heels and, like Caitlyn, she too styled her tresses into perfect curls that sat just past her shoulders.

Her appearance alongside Kylie's father comes after Caitlyn continued to fuel speculation the pair are 'dating' by refusing to address rumours she and Sophia are romantically linked in a new interview with Variety.

Caitlyn addressed her relationship with Sophia, self-confessing the duo are 'inseparable', but wouldn't comment when asked if the pair were romantically involved.

'We are not going to get into that,' the Olympic champion said in response. Although, Caitlyn did add: 'But we are very close. We do a lot of things together.'

'We're inseparable,' she claimed. 'We're the best of friends.'

The former husband of Keeping Up With The Kardashians momager Kris Jenner famously underwent gender reassignment surgery in January 2017 after previously revealing her plans to transition from Bruce to Caitlyn in 2015.

Sophia transitioned while a student at Pepperdine University in Malibu and cited Caitlyn as her role model.

Just last month, the pair attended the ESPY Awards together and in June she opted to attend a charity ball in Vienna, Austria, with Sophia instead of attending her son Brody's wedding.

Caitlyn has grown closer to Sophia amid the distance that's widened between her amid rifts with some of her children and Kardashian step children.

A source previously told Heat Magazine of their relationship: 'Cait really sees herself spending the rest of her life with Sophia.

Caitlyn appeared to acknowledge the distance from her family that includes children from three marriages and now grandchildren.

She admitted to Variety that she is closer to some of her offspring than others.

As for her ex-wife Kris, with whom she shares her daughters Kendall and Kylie, 'We havenâ€™t talked in a long time,' she said.
