Happy birthday, Robert Pattinson! The actor turns 31 years old today, and he has come a long way since his days as a Cedric Diggory in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.

Pattinson encountered major fame when he was cast as Edward Cullen in the young adult novel-turned-blockbuster Twilight, thrusting him and his co-stars into the spotlight. When the franchise wrapped in 2012, the actor made a major career change, springing for indie films like Maps to the Stars, Life, and Good Time.
