Judge Judy gets apology for false National Enquirer Alzheimer story

Judge Judy had a big win against the National Enquirer.

The tabloid mag had to apologize to the TV judge after they published a false story claiming she had Alzheimer's disease and cheated on her husband, Jerry Sheindlin, among other accusations like Nicole Sheindlin's step-daughter was facing jail time. They backtracked on all of the incorrect allegations.

The gossip rag wrote a statement titled, “Apology Regarding Judge Judy And Nicole Sheindlin." Nicole is Judy's step-daughter with her husband Jerry Sheindlin.

The message read, "We and our sister publication, the National Examiner, recently published articles which stated that Judge Judy Sheindlin suffered from ‘brain disease,’ was ‘fighting’ both Alzheimer’s and depression, and ‘is hiding a heartbreaking medical crisis.’ We also published articles which stated that Judge Judy cheated on her husband, and that her daughter Nicole Sheindlin faced jail time for refusing to serve on a jury. None of these statements are true and we unequivocally retract them.”

It went on, “The National Enquirer, the National Examiner, and American Media Inc., sincerely apologize to Judge Judy. The National Enquirer, the National Examiner, and American Media Inc., also sincerely apologize to Nicole, who is a respected attorney and is the CEO of Her Honor Mentoring.”
