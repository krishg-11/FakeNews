Solved: Question about a missing song

Hey @minizilla30

Spotify likely does not have permission from the artist for that song to be available.

Spotify tries really hard to get music available on their service, but in the end the availability of music on Spotify is up to the artist and their music label.



This thread by Spotify staff explains why some music is not available:
