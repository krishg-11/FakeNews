Jay-Z may have splashed the cash on a night out in New York, but some people are complaining that his $11,100 (£7,944.49) tip just wasn’t enough.

The hip hop mogul reportedly racked up a whopping $91,135 (£65,227.14) bar tab at the New York Playroom club for a friend’s birthday on Sunday, as well as few other expenditures.

According to Page Six, the father-of-three also treated his pals to a $13,000 (£9,304.36) meal at Japanese restaurant Zuma before stopping off at bar Made in Mexico for $9,000 (£6,441.48) worth of drinks – all before heading to the Playroom.

Ever the business man, the billionaire reportedly paid for 40 bottles of his own Ace Of Spades Champagne to go along with the $80,035 table for his friend and Roc Nation associate’s 50th b’day celebrations.

To top the night off, the 48-year-old music star also left enough room in his wallet to pay the bar staff an $11,100 tip before he left.

But news of the generous service charge left some people unhappy, with one person even calling the star a ‘weak ass tipper’ for paying the staff less than 15% of the overall bill.

I typically tip 18-20%, this bozo spends $91,000 and only tips 12%?? Jay-Z has 99 problem but being a weak ass tipper ain’t one! — Darrel Robinson (@texasdarrel) February 20, 2018

Not even 20% smh — Morris Fabbri (@MoMoneyMoFabbri) February 20, 2018

That's only a 13.87% tip, Jay Z. pic.twitter.com/v4cMkKKwSQ — Rudolf E. Havenstein (@RudyHavenstein) February 21, 2018

Service must have sucked,because that isn't even the customary tip of 15% or 21% or Jay-Z was ripped and couldn't figure out 15 or 21% of $91,135 I'll give him that…that's a lot of jet fuel ⛽️ — Jim Hatch (@Troutconsiglier) February 20, 2018

Although us Brits are use to seeing a 10-12% service charge on the end of our bill, in America the average tip is based around 15-20%.

Not everyone was up in arms about the tip, with some fans getting excited for the lucky waitress on the receiving end of the thousand dollar cash out.

Imagine Jay Z randomly comes to your work 1 day and leaves you that tip, Jesus be my inhaler I would actually pass out. https://t.co/1WTMuBhJsm — YT: The Focus Group (@manlikekofii) February 19, 2018

imagine waking up thinking you’re gonna have a bad day at work, and getting an $11,100 tip from Jay Z https://t.co/T8lTETkJ9C — cort❁ (@cortneeymariexo) February 20, 2018

Jay-Z doing so many bottles in the club last night just made me rethink my profession ? the waitress made a 11 thousand dollar tip wtf — tatyanaa:*♡ (@princesstatyy) February 19, 2018

The lady (dayhana) that served Jay Z is the real winner here. That tip might be her annual salary. pic.twitter.com/loK4nAnLJy — Senator Wale Abba (@waleabba) February 21, 2018

Jay-Z’s apparent bill first came to light after a server posted the black-and-white receipt on Snapchat, causing the star’s expenditure to go viral.
