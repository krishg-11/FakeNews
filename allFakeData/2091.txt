American singer and actress Jennifer Lopez is expecting a baby boy with former baseball star Alex Rodriguez (41), according to Life and Style Magazine.

The 47-year-old Lopez has been dating the New York Yankees legend since February this year, and it wouldn't surprise many if the rumour about the baby turns out to be true.

A source from the magazine revealed that the couple had decided to have a baby within the first few months of their relationship as they felt they are a great match. Considering their ages, they may not want to waste time.

Meanwhile, the insider added Lopez and Rodriguez are discussing possible names for their son, while JLo is making preparations in designing a baseball-themed nursery for the kid.

Lopez already has twins Max David and Emme Maribel (nine) with singer and ex-husband Marc Anthony.

Rodriguez is father to Natasha (13) and Ella Alexander (nine) with Cynthia Scurtis, whom he divorced in 2008. JLo and A-Rod certainly do have the experience in parenting.
