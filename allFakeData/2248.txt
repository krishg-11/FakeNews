Watch Out, Kris! Caitlyn Jenner Plans To Launch Her Own Talk Show After Ex's Chat Fest Flop

Watch Out, Kris! Caitlyn Jenner Plans To Launch Her Own Talk Show After Ex's Chat Fest Flop ‘She’s so determined to make it a hit.’

RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal Caitlyn Jenner is making plans to launch her own talk show!

“Cait has been plotting her next move for some time now, and she’s completely set on landing a show of her own,” an insider revealed.

“She thinks this is a great way to give people who haven’t been heard a platform to tell their story, while getting back in favor with the LGBTQ community at the same time.”

Jenner, 68, is brave to attempt a chat fest, especially since the former Olympian’s ex-wife, Kris, and stepdaughter, Khloe, both failed in their efforts.

Still, “Cait’s convinced this is going to be more successful than both Kris and Khloe’s shows, and is even toying with the idea of calling it Cocktails with Caitlyn,” a throwback to Kardashian’s program, Kocktails with Khloe.

“Cait is pitching the idea to networks and is happy to sink her own money into this because she’s so determined to make it a hit.”
