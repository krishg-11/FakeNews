Jessica Hits Rock Bottom!

Boozed Up and 40 Pounds Overweight, Jessica Simpson Could Lose Her Kids if She Can’t Clean Up Her Act.

SONGBIRD turned fashion mogul Jessica Simpson is bursting at the seams, looking anything but pulled together lately. But it’s not her shocking 40-pound weight gain or sloppy attire that has loved ones worried. Rather, it’s her wine-swilling, bingeand-purge lifestyle that’s endangering her health and could ultimately cause her children to be taken from her.

“Poor Jess really seems to be losing it,” confides a friend. “Lately, she’s been looking trashed, slurring her words, not making sense — no wonder people think she’s drunk, on drugs or both. There’s real concern that she’s on her way to a serious health problem, possibly even an overdose, if she continues down this path.”

ABUSING HER BODY

After a boozy coast-to-coast flight on Aug. 10, Jessica, 37, was spotted spilling out of LAX airport, barely able to walk. The bloated, double-chinned mother of two was wobbly as she made her way to a waiting car and nearly passed out as soon as she got inside.
