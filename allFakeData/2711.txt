David Beckham And Victoria Beckham Reportedly Bought Harper £7,000 Pony For 7th Birthday

If you were one of those kids that asked for a pony every birthday of your childhood, only to find yourself receiving last season’s Barbie doll and a McDonald’s McFlurry, you might want to look away now.

To celebrate Harper Beckham’s birthday, David and Victoria have reportedly splashed the cash and bought her a £7,000 pedigree pony.

A soure reportedly told the Sun: ‘A few months ago, David and Victoria bought Harper some riding lessons and she fell in love with the sport.

‘She’s horse-mad and has spent the past few weeks badgering her parents for a pony of her own.’



The youngster - who turns seven today - has also reportedly received riding gear from Colne Saddlery in Cheltenham.

'Obviously, a horse is a massive commitment, and David and Victoria have impressed upon her how important it is that she cares for it herself and gets stuck into the mucking out. They then visited a saddlery last month and got her all the accessories,' the source added.

‘The pony is an extravagant gift but Harper is aware of just how lucky she is.’

Harper’s new 'present' will settle in right at home in the family’s new country home in the Cotswolds where they have their own stables.

Earlier today, Victoria posted a sweet birthday message to her daughter on Instagram with the caption: ‘Happy Birthday baby girl x We love u so so much x so many kisses!!!’

The proud mother - who also shares sons Brooklyn, Cruz and Romeo wit her husband of 19 years - also took to Instagram Stories to share videos of inflatable unicorn and heart decorations for Harper’s big day.
