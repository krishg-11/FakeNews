Kanye West Is Reportedly Furious At Taylor Swift For Mocking Kim Kardashian's Robbery

And while Kim and Kanye "don't care" about the song and think that it's "pathetic", the rapper is reportedly outraged that Tay has mocked the incident in her music video.

“He was upset that Taylor exploited Kim’s robbery,” a source close to the rapper told HollywoodLife.com.

“Kanye feels like that was not cool because the incident was a very serious and dangerous situation.”

Ultimately, he "just feels as though it’s something that Taylor shouldn’t have mocked.”

Kanye isn't the only one to have said this as many critics and fans have slammed Tay for making light of the robbery.

But at the end of the day, Tay hasn't *actually* confirmed that the scene is about the Paris attack.

It could have been a reference to her sexual assault trial as a single dollar bill can be seen in the tub which is all Taylor wanted from winning the case.

It could also be a nod to that time when Taylor made the following statement about the media:

"Every single article had these descriptions of my personality that were very different from the actual personality and my first reaction was like, that's a bummer, this isn't fun for me. But then my second reaction ended up being like, hey, that's actually a really interesting character they're writing about. 'She jetsets around the world collecting men and she can get any of them but she's so clingy that they leave and she cries and she gets another one in her web and she traps them and locks them in her mansion and she's crying in her marble bathtub surrounded by pearls.' So I was like, I could use this..."

So in summary: have a seat Kanye.
