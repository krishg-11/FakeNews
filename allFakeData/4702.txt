Rihanna wants to get together with Chris Brown and I’m irrationally upset about it

Apparently Rihanna is having a (slightly more than) quarter life c(h)risis, and reconsidering whether or not she wants to stay with her billionaire boyfriend, or get back together with Chris Brown.

The ex couple's relationship ended when Brown attacked her on the way to the Grammy's Awards party in 2009, to which he pled guilty. However, according to Hollywood Life, the "Work" singer “wants to get together” with Brown, because she "has a special place in her heart for him," and feels like they still have some "unfinished business."

The site reported that upon turning 30, Rihanna made a list of things she wanted to do for herself, however it might not be with who we think.

"What made the list was to make peace with some things in her past, including her history with Chris Brown,” a source close to the singer told Hollywood Life, adding that she feels like her story with Chris is "not done yet."

The source said that although she probably won't get back together with him at this moment, "she is thinking about meeting up with Chris for dinner.”

This report comes after multiple reports last week that Rihanna and Chris Brown still talk "all the time." And on Rihanna's 30th birthday he even posted an Instagram celebrating her.
