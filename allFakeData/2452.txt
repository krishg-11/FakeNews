Jennifer Aniston reveals the truth about her divorce from Justin Theroux

An explosive report from Life & Style states that their two and a half year marriage was 'dysfunctional from the get-go' and 'never a real marriage.'



According to pals of the former Friends star, Jen would often end up at best friend Courteney Cox’s house in floods of tears.

'The way Jen sees it, Justin simply refused to change,' says the source. 'Especially when it came to his relationship with other women.'



Just weeks after they announced their shock break up, Justin took to Instagram to promote a homeless pets shelter. However eagle-eyed fans were quick to notice that the star hashtagged Selena Gomez, a former friend of Jen’s and one of many females who Justin was rumoured to have got a little too close to during their relationship.



'Justin is a classic ladies’ man and flirt, and it always drove Jen up the wall,' spills the friend.

'One of the worst moments for Jen was when she started seeing Justin flirt with her friends.



'Women are very drawn to Justin. All her celeb friends were charmed by him at one point or another.'



Furthermore, the source goes on to reveal that the former couple shared 'harsh words' over the years about their differing lifestyles – with Justin refusing to leave his bachelor pad in New York and live with Jen on the West Coast.



And in a heartbreaking confession, the insider reveals it was obvious Justin’s heart was never really in their relationship.

'Jen complained he never said ‘I love you'.'



'One thing is certain: She’s done being put through hell by Justin.'

Jen and Justin have not responded to Life & Style’s report.
