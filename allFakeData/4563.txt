Justin Bieber can’t get a Beverly Hills rental

Justin Bieber’s reputation as a party-loving house-trasher and terrible neighbor is biting him in the butt. Page Six reports that Beverly Hills landowners have banded together to reject Bieber from renting a house in the neighborhood.

An unnamed real estate agent told Page Six that Bieber “wants to rent a big estate, but many of the owners of the big Beverly Hills properties, which are for rent, have clubbed together to agree that nobody should rent to Justin.”

The Canadian pop star is better known for upsetting his neighbors with dangerous driving and random eggings than for his house-destroying parties, but whatever the reason, Beverly Hills residents really don’t want him in their ‘hood. Bieber is reportedly offering well over the asking rent—up to $100,000 a month—and still no one has rented him any of the places he’s interested in.

Cast out of the Bev Hills rental market, poor Bieber has been forced to move into an unidentified posh hotel in the neighborhood. He’s rented quarters in the hotel “for up to a year,” says Page Six.

Bieber has rented in Beverly Hills before, taking up residence in a $59,000-a-month glass house that looks a bit like a glamorous salad spinner. (It was a short-term lease.)
