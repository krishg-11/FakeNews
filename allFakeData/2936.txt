Justin Bieber posts picture of his acne to Instagram

He's a former spokesperson for Proactiv's acne-fighting skincare range.

But it looks like Justin Bieber might need to start using the anti-pimple face wash again, based on a recent Instagram Story in which the 24-year-old showed off a collection of spots on his forehead.

The Baby singer captioned the post: 'Pimples are in.'

The star joined the likes of Katy Perry and Jessica Simpson in 2010 to become a spokesperson for the California-based direct marketing company.

Earlier this month, the Despacito singer posted a much more flattering series of pictures to his Instagram account.

In the March 8 photos, the sun-bathed pop star shows off his toned and tattooed torso as he stood in the sand, arms held aloft.

In another example of the singer not being afraid to poke fun at himself, Bieber posted an unflattering photoshopped version of himself to Instagram on Thursday.

In the profile shot, the singer is shown with a pony tail, a weak chin and an elongated nose.

'Itâ€™s time I introduced you to my brother Tony Bieber,' he captioned the photo.
