Jennifer Lopez Refuses To Marry Alex Rodriguez Unless He Follows Strict Pre-Wedding Rules!

J. Lo's Way Or The Highway! Diva Singer Puts Ultra-Strict Pre-Wedding Rules On A-Rod She 'won't marry him' unless he follows her demands.

Diva Jennifer Lopez won’t marry Alex Rodriguez unless he follows her ultra-strict pre-wedding rules, RadarOnline.com has learned exclusively!

“There’s a lot of talk around whether J.Lo and A-Rod will get engaged, but Jennifer has a list of requirements a guy has to agree to before she’ll even consider marriage,” snitches a source.

Moving in together is going to have to happen before any kind of engagement, says the informant, noting: “But Jen will keep her home and wants Alex to give up his!”

“It’s how she did things when she and Marc Anthony first got together, and he let go of his old house.”

Is Lopez, 48, letting her shallow side get in the way of true love? The insider spills, “She also loves Alex’s fit physique and wants formal assurances he won’t let himself go as soon as she says ‘I do’! Jennifer is seriously controlling, but she knows what she wants. If Alex wants to spend the rest of his life with her, he’s going to have to play by her rules.”

This isn’t the first time Lopez has attempted to control her baseball beau. As fans know, the singer hired a private investigator over the summer to keep tabs on Rodriguez, 42, after the couple was plagued by cheating rumors when the National Enquirer published an interview with his alleged former mistress Lauren Hunter.

“She’s really into Alex and wants it to work,” a source told US Weekly. “So she’s trying to control as much as she can.”
