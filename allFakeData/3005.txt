She is what one may call the epitome of 'beauty with brains'. Besides being an MIT professor, this American-Israeli architect also has a TED talk to her credit.

She is 42 but doesn't look a day older than 22 if you ask me, also this amazing woman has a legit Ph.D. in design computation for MIT.

Though it is believed that the couple is keeping things under the wraps, but knowing Pitt, the cat will soon be out of the bag.
