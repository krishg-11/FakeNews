Grammys 2018: Complete list of winners and nominees

Bruno Mars led the 60th Grammy Awards with wins for record, album and song as his “24K Magic” helped him pull ahead of Kendrick Lamar late in the show. Alessia Cara took home the new artist award, but it was Mars and Lamar who stole the show with multiple awards for each.

Oscar darling “La La Land” scored two pre-show prizes and was among the winners of about 70 categories announced during the pretelecast show hosted by Paul Shaffer. Presenters included Zac Brown, Natalie Grant and Bernie Herms, Ledisi, Lisa Loeb and Neil deGrasse Tyson. Body Count, India.Arie, Jazzmeia Horn, Taj Mahal & Keb’ Mo’ and Stile Antico performed in pre-show selections.

With James Corden as the primetime host, the Grammy Awards embraced rap and hip-hop in the top categories this year, with several major nominations each for Jay-Z, Kendrick Lamar and Childish Gambino, who also won the Grammy for traditional R&B performance.

Jay-Z led this year’s nominees with eight, while Lamar picked up seven, and pop singer-songwriter Bruno Mars earned six. Gambino, the alter ego of Emmy-winning actor-director Donald Glover, netted five nominations, along with singer Khalid and producer-songwriter No I.D.

One of the year’s biggest hits, the remix version of Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee’s “Despacito,” featuring Justin Bieber, has become the first non-English-language track to be nominated in both the song and record of the year categories.
