Fifty Shades Freed: How Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson REALLY feel about each-other

SG Fifty Shades: Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan star

Does this footage reveal the truth of their working relationship? B-roll from Fifty Shades Darker - quick, candid shots from the set of the movie - show them interacting when the cameras stop rolling. And by the looks of it - as you can see for yourself below - they really do get on like firm friends. In one supermarket-set scene, Johnson even has to try and control her laughter as Dornan fools around in front of her.

The pair are also seen goofing around under an umbrella between takes on another scene - seemingly putting rumours that they despise one-another to rest. The shots line up perfectly with what Dornan and Johnson each said earlier in the year, when they spoke very highly of one-another. “It’s genuinely one of the fastest, closest friendships I’ve ever made in my life, just based on the amount of time we’ve actually known each other,” Johnson told OK! “I love Jamie, I trust him and I really couldn’t tell you if I could have done this without him.”
