Selena Gomez: I've Never Had a Problem With Drinking

Selena Gomez is writing her own narrative.

The tabloids have been running rampant with headlines about her alleged bad behavior, and now, the "Good for You singer is setting the record straight in Billboard's Oct. 17 issue. "I've never had a problem with drinking," she says defiantly. That's not to say her life is perfect, of course. Not too long ago, she says, "I felt like I'd lost everything. Just because it's not plastered everywhere doesn't mean I didn't have my rock bottom. I've had my moments, and it's almost unsafe for me to even talk about them, because I'll be taken advantage of."

In 2013, after releasing her debut solo album Stars Dance, Gomez abruptly canceled the end of her tour, saying she needed to "spend some time on myself." Then, in January 2014, she checked herself into The Meadows, an Arizona-based rehab.

"I was diagnosed with lupus, and I've been through chemotherapy," the actress reveals. "That's what my break was really about. I could've had a stroke."
