Golden Globes 2018: the complete list of nominees

The 2018 Golden Globes, hosted by Seth Meyers, will be awarded on Sunday, January 8, with the ceremony airing live at 8 pm Eastern on NBC. (It will also be live-streamed online for the first time.)

The annual event, which honors performances in both television and film, is considered one of Hollywood’s most “fun” awards shows due to how early the awards fall in the season, the presence of alcohol (resulting in more celebrities letting loose), and general unpredictability about the winners. In other words, they’re usually a pretty good time, as far as three-hour awards shows go.

But this year’s event might take on a more somber tone, due to the recent wave of revelations regarding sexual harassment in the entertainment industry, and the rise of the #MeToo movement.

Many actors and actresses have promised to wear black to raise awareness of the movement and protest sexual harassment in Hollywood. And the marketing for the ceremony has implied that it will offer a platform for speaking out; one promo even features Meyers declaring, “Hollywood, we’ve got a lot to talk about.”

When it comes to the awards themselves, the film frontrunner appears to be The Shape of Water, Guillermo del Toro’s grown-up fairy tale about a mute woman and a fish-man, which leads the nominations with seven. Steven Spielberg’s The Post and Martin McDonagh’s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri follow, with six nominations each.

In the TV categories, HBO’s Big Little Lies leads the pack with six nods. Feud: Bette and Joan has four, while The Handmaid’s Tale, This Is Us, and Fargo each have three nominations.

You’ll find the full list of nominees below. Come back to Vox on Sunday night for our live coverage of the ceremony!
