Alexandra Daddario Shuts Down Zac Efron Dating Reports a Second Time

Zac Efron's rumored girlfriend Alexandra Daddario—the one whose Instagrams Efron aggressively liked and commented on earlier this year—just shut down reports that she and Efron are romantically involved for the second time since dating rumors about them began. Daddario told People today at a Kleenex Wet Wipes launch party that, “We’re very good friends. Zac and I’ve worked together, and we’re very good friends.”

She previously made it clear they were only friends to the press in May 2017, so one whole year ago. "I don't know that I started it," she told E! during Baywatch press when asked about the dating rumor. "We work together closely; he's my love interest in the film. I understand why people would go crazy over something like that, but Zac and I are very good friends."

On Instagram these days, Efron has also laid off liking everything. The last photo of Daddario's he liked was posted on May 10. Since he made headlines for his comments on Daddario's April 4 shot, Efron has only liked five Instagrams that Daddario has posted. No flirty comments recurred.

People previously reported via a source in March that Daddario and Efron were seeing each other "on and off since their time working together on the movie last year, but they are not officially dating," the source said. Guess not anymore.
