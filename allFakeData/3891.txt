Jennifer Garner Told 'She Can Do Better' Amid Reports She & Ben Affleck Are 'Spending Nights Together'

Something obviously doesn't add up, and 'Us' might have itself to blame.

In the same article questioning Ben and Jen's reconciliation, Us Weekly also reports Ben "loves and adores" Lindsay and is taking their relationship "seriously." The outlet also notes another source states "when they filed and decided they were moving on, that was it."

Yeah, we'll believe this when Jennifer Garner and Josh Duhamel actually start dating (LOL).
