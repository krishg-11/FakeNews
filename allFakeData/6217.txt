Beyoncé's Stealth Road to Giving Birth to Twins

Beyoncé's twins are here!

E! News has confirmed that the pop icon and husband Jay Z welcomed their second and third kids. The twins join big sister Blue Ivy Carterin the most royal of famous family folds, short of being actual royalty.

You're probably wondering, aren't they a little early? (As if Bey's children could be persuaded to stay put when they're ready to roll...) Well, their arrival is a little ahead of the late June/early July due date some people had settled on with their fancy guess work, counting down from when Mrs. Shawn Carter's much analyzed, imitated and parodied pregnancy reveal on Instagram made everybody's day on Feb. 1. But a source had told E! News that the twins were actually due by the end of this month.

Once again, nature works its wonders, and even the Carter family is at its mercy. Though if anyone's going to whip up a little of her own mystery fog, it's Beyoncé...
