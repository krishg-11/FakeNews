Khloé Kardashian Wants Tristan Thompson Engagement Before Announcing Pregnancy





It’s a race against the clock for Tristan Thompson to propose to Khloé Kardashian! The denim designer reportedly doesn’t want to be an unwed mother, and according to a Radar source, she doesn’t even want to make the announcement until there’s a ring on her finger.

“Khloé is pushing her man for a ring harder than ever before now,” said the insider. “At this point, she is practically begging him to propose. She does not want to be just his girlfriend when this baby is born and she wants him to do it stat!” Khloé has not yet publicly admitted that she’s expecting, but since her alleged due date is in February, she doesn’t have long before the cat is out of the bag. Tristan better hurry up!

Khloé hasn’t been shy about wanting to marry Tristan, even as far back as April (which is when she is reported to have conceived the baby.” When asked if she would accept a proposal from Tristan in ES magazine, she enthusiastically said “Yes, I would.” She also gushed about him, saying she had “never been in this kind of love before.” Furthermore, she hinted about having kids, which in hindsight should have tipped us off that she was about to get pregnant (or was already.)

“I would love to have a family. We’ve talked about it,” she admitted. “He is a father, and I know for a fact that he would be an impeccable father.” Tristan’s ex-girlfriend Jordan Craig gave birth to his child in December 2016, after he and Khloé started dating. So, you can see why she wants to lock him down officially before the baby comes. No one wants to be just another random baby mama! It sounds like they’re both on the same page and want to spend their future together, so Tristan should just bite the bullet already and pop the question!
