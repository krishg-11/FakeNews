AceShowbiz - %cJoshua Jackson% allegedly has a "secret affair" with %cJanuary Jones%. Star magazine is the first to report that the 38-year-old actor has been secretly dating the "X-Men: First Class" actress ever since he broke up with his longtime girlfriend %cDiane Kruger% last July.

"Jackson is nursing his broken heart with help from longtime pal January," claims the tabloid, before quoting sources as saying that the Canadian hunk has "been secretly seeing" Jones ever since splitting up with the German actress.

A source reveals, "In a lot of ways, Josh is the perfect guy for January," before explaining, "He's not much of a partier. He gets along with her son, Xander. Plus they have a ton of mutual friends," including his ex-girlfriend. "January hates going behind Diane's back, but she isn't exactly pushing Josh away either," the insider says, adding, "If they don't come clean soon though, things could get messy."

However, the report made by Star magazine turns out to be false. A rep for Jones tells Gossip Cop that the 39-year-old actress is not having a "secret affair" with Jackson. Her rep assures fans that the above claim "isn't true."
