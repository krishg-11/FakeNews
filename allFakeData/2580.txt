You will not BELIEVE how much George and Amal Clooney are spending on the delivery of their twins!

If recent reports are to believe, Hollywood power couple George and Amal Clooney are planning to spend over a million dollars for the delivery of their twins!

Earlier this year, it was confirmed that George and Amal were expecting twins, which British tabloids reported to be a boy and a girl. George wants to make sure the twins enter the world in the most royal manner possible.

According to entertainment portal Aceshowbiz.com, the Hollywood star has rented out the entire Kensington Wing at London's Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, which essentially comes down to $580,000 for a week's stay. Amal is also apparently flying in two 'birth companions' from Los Angeles for around $30,000. George also wants Amal to be completely relaxed during the birth, which is why he hired an Italian masseuse for the hotshot lawyer for $5,000.

The couple is already known to be pretty generous with their money. Amidst reports that they might spend a million dollars on their nursery, George and Amal reportedly gave their neighbours a £45,000 compensation package for the noise caused by the renovations to their estate recently. The package was said to include a holiday to Corfu, a six-week stay in a luxury hotel and a £30,000 lump sum. In addition, the Clooneys paid for their neighbours to rent a £780,000 cottage.

Recently, George was advised on raising twins by Prince Albert of Monaco, who has twins himself. He said "George should pour himself a good cup of coffee each morning." He also added that he'd better get "some sleep stored away before the babies are born".
