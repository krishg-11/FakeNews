Jeremy Hashville, a Michigan elector, has taken his own life to avoid voting in favor of Trump despite Trump’s victory as state laws requires him to vote, an act he hopes others will have the courage to follow to “save his country”.

A tragic end

According to the Detroit City Coroner’s report, the last moments of Mr. Hashville would have been “excruciating painful”.

“The deceased would have first attempted to take his life by swallowing 36 laxative tablets that he possibly mistook for antidepressants” describes the 236 pages report.

“Despite intolerable intestinal pain, the man then threw himself in front of a bus after literally throwing himself from the balcony of his apartment on the sixth floor but would have miraculously survived,” commented James Arnold of the Detroit Police.

“The deceased would have finally covered his own body with gasoline before succumbing to his injuries after lighting himself on fire by inserting his head into the family microwave,” he concluded about the tragic death.
