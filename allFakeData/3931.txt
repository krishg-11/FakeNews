Meghan Markle Is Reportedly Engaged, in London, and Moving in With Prince Harry

Meghan Markle just wrapped and left her series Suits last week—and, true to what sources have been suggesting to outlets for months—was spotted in London Monday. Movers were seen at her Toronto apartment, and now People is reporting that Markle is in the process of moving in with Prince Harry at Kensington Palace. “It’s not a question of if she’s moving in, it’s just a matter of when," a source told the outlet.

“Harry has made no secret of the fact that he wants to marry her. She is the one.”

Meanwhile, Us Weekly is going one step further and reporting that yes, the two are totally engaged now, planning a summer wedding (it'll happen by late June), and that Markle is indeed moving in with Harry ASAP. “There are are no plans for them to live separately,” a friend of Markle’s told the outlet. “Meghan will move right in.”

Their official engagement announcement, Us claims via an insider, “will likely be some time in January. It gives Meghan some to get settled and will be a great start to 2018.”



Markle and Prince Harry will live together in his two-bedroom Nottingham Cottage on the Kensington Palace grounds. Prince William and Kate Middleton also lived together in a North Wales farmhouse before they got married.
