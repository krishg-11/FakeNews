Producers of the film Ocean’s Eight are said to have hired a therapist to prevent any fights between its all-female cast members, which includes Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Rihanna and Anne Hathaway.

According to OK! Magazine, the producers have a counsellor on call to make sure the women get along, reports aceshowbiz.com. “There have been a few arguments, and certain people haven’t gotten on as well as they’d hoped,” a source claims. They want to make sure the cast and crew have someone to vent any frustrations to, so nothing gets taken out on another actor,” a source said.

The source added: “The aim is to wrap the movie on a good note and set the stage for later promotion.”

Directed by Gary Ross from a script written by Ross and co-writer Olivia Milch, “Ocean’s Eight” is set to hit theatres in the United States on June 8, 2018.
