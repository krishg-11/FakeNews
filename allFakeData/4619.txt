Why Miley Cyrus Skipped the Teen Choice Awards Last Minute

The Teen Choice Awards brought out some of our favorite celebrities on Sunday night, but there was one face missing in the crowd: Miley Cyrus. Even though the "Malibu" singer was set to receive the ultimate choice award during the show, Victoria Justice revealed that she had to drop out last minute when she took to the stage to present. Even though we are pretty bummed she couldn't make it — who doesn't love a good Miley appearance? — her reason for backing out totally makes up for it.

Shortly after the show, Miley posted a heartfelt apology to her fans along with some very exciting news — she has new music coming out! "To my dearest fans & all of those watching @teenchoicefox I want to say thank you from the very bottom of my heart for presenting me with #TheUltimateChoiceAward," she wrote. "I am beyond bummed I couldn't make it to the show as I had every intention of being there to accept and celebrate this honor! I created an unrealistic schedule for myself which leads me to this announcement! I've been tryin to keep the secret but I can't hide it any longer! My new single / music video #YoungerNow will be dropping this Friday , Aug 18th & I am sooooooo EXCITED to share it with all of you! I hope to always make people smile and shine light thru my work! I look forward to making music for the rest of my life and I'm thankful everyday for those who listen! I am sending so much love and peace into the world right now because THATS what we need most! Love Love & more LOVE! ❤️💙💚💛💜❤️💙💚💛💜"
