Kristen Stewart breaks Cannes rule and walks red carpet barefoot

Kristen Stewart has no time for Cannes Film Festival’s outdated fashion rules. Because that’s the icon and queen she is.

Stewart, who serves as a member of the festival’s jury this year, walked the red carpet on the way to a screening of Spike Lee’s new film BlacKkKlansman.

Wearing a pair of Christian Louboutin stilettos, she promptly took them off after posing for photos and walked the rest of the red carpet barefoot.

It’s a great moment in and of itself. However, it gets even better when you remember Cannes has a heels-only rule for red carpet screenings.

It’s no joke — women were turned away from a screening of Carol in 2015 because their shoes’ heels weren’t tall enough.

But when Stewart decided it was time for the shows to come off, that’s exactly what she did.

‘Things need to change’

Stewart has talked about Cannes’ antiquated rules before.

She told Vanity Fair in 2016: ‘Things have to change immediately.

‘It has become really obvious that if [a man and I] were walking the red carpet together and someone stopped me and said, “Excuse me, young lady, you’re not wearing heels. You cannot come in.” Then [I’m going to say], “Neither is my friend. Does he have to wear heels?” It can work both ways.’

That same year, Julia Roberts also went barefoot.

Many people love Stewart’s move — and how could they not?

Not to mention all the wonderful photos of Stewart and Cate Blanchett that people are dying over.
