Ellen DeGeneres confronted by waitress over tip?

Popular American talk show host Ellen DeGeneres was confronted by a waitress at a cafe here over a tip, says a source.

According to website National Enquirer, the 58-year-old host was reportedly leaving the coffee shop she frequents without giving her regular waitress a tip. This happened twice, reports aceshowbiz.com.

DeGeneres and the waitress had the confrontation at the second occasion.

When the comedienne walked out of the cafe, the waitress reportedly asked her: "Hey, Ellen, aren't you forgetting something?"

The 29-time Emmy winner, however, responded by turning around and saying: "Oh, right... buh-bye!"

A source close to "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" host laughed when asked about the allegation, assuring fans that it never happened.
