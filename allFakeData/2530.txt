The upcoming season of “Dancing with the Stars” is shaping up to be star-packed.

We hear ABC is actively in talks to land Caitlyn Jenner for the 26th season, which will feature just 10 athletes for an unusually short four-week season.

If the 68-year-old Olympic gold medalist signs on the dotted line, she’ll be the third member of her family to slip on their dancing shoes for cameras.

Stepdaughter Kim Kardashian competed in the seventh season and placed 11th in the competition. Rob Kardashian competed in the 13th season and became the first runner-up.

While recruiting the trans activist could be a good idea for ratings, we’re told insiders are worried about potential backlash because of her political views. Jenner has been confronted before over her opinions. In June 2017, Amanda Seales took her to task at Katy Perry’s “Friends and Family: Dinner with Discourse” event.

When asked about the casting news, ABC told Page Six in a statement, “We do not confirm or comment on casting rumors. We’ll be announcing our cast closer to our premiere date.” Season 26 is expected to premiere this spring.

Jenner’s rep simply said, “Not true.”
