Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt to reunite in new romantic comedy

Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt quietly rekindled their relationship several months ago, and not it appears the pair are ready to make it official.

A report from The Sun has claimed the former lovers are 'seriously' considering starring together in a new romantic comedy.

'As well as being back in touch as friends, suddenly an opportunity has cropped up that would put Brad and Jen in a major movie together for the first time - and they're seriously considering it,' a source told Heat magazine.

Although, the roles would not see the pair play lovers. They would need to interact on screen though.

'It's not like they would be playing lovers or anything, but the project is in the romantic comedy genre and their characters would cross paths. The movie producers are really excited and feel this would be dynamite casting,' the source continued.
