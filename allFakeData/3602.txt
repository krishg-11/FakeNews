US REPORT: Jennifer Aniston confronts Justin Theroux's lover Emma Stone

In the three months since news broke of Justin Theroux and Jennifer Aniston's split, the actor has been spotted getting cozy with multiple women. In particular, the 46-year-old hunk has been jetsetting the globe with actress Emma Stone.

Star reports the Jen has had enough!

An insider explosively told the publication that Jen has her guard up and 'refuses to play the fool again.'

After being blindsided by ex-husband Brad Pitt, and his highly publicised re-coupling with Angelina Jolie, the 49-year-old actress has been left wondering whether Justin had been 'staying true' to her in the months leading up to their split.

'She wants some answers,' a source tells Star.
