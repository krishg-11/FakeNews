Amal Clooney does not want to be friends with Angelina Jolie.

George Clooney’s wife has snubbed mother-of-six Jolie after she reached-out to her.

Amal, 39, who has recently had twins, Ella and Alexander, was not interested after Jolie, 42, tried to mend their friendship.

An insider tells Star: “Angie went out of her way to try and mend fences, reasoning there’s a lot of water under the bridge and life’s too short for petty grudges.’

“But Amal was bemused at the suggestions she would want to socialize with a woman she barely knows – let alone has any respect for! She turned her down flat!”

This snub infuriated Jolie who thought that her approach would be warmly welcomed when she admitted that her divorce from Brad Pitt has been very difficult.

The source adds: “She’s got no idea why Amal and George for that matter have an issue with her.”

“Angie wanted them to be friends since they have so much in common and Brad’s not standing in the way anymore. But now she accepts it’s not going to happen.”
