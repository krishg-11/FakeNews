2018 Daytime Emmy nominations: Full list of nominees for 45th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards

The 45th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards nominations honoring the best in daytime television were announced on Wednesday, March 21, live on the CBS talk show “The Talk.” Winners will be revealed during the Creative Arts Daytime Emmys on April 27, followed by the main ceremony on Sunday, April 29. So who made the cut for these awards? Scroll down for the complete list.

The Daytime Emmy Awards cover a wide variety of programming including soap operas, talk shows, game shows, children’s shows, animation and more. In recent years the awards have also expanded into the online streaming realm, just like their primetime counterparts, so digital drama series and programs from Netflix and Amazon are also represented.

The awards for dramatic acting are unique as they undergo an extra pre-nominations phase of voting. TV academy members watched short sample clips of all entrants for lead and supporting awards. The top 10 vote-getters in each category became the pre-nominees, who then submitted performance reels up to 20 minutes in length for review by blue ribbon panels who decided the final nominees and winners in one round. The contenders in younger acting categories skipped the initial round: all eligible candidates in those two races became automatic pre-nominees and went straight to the blue ribbon round.
