Kris Jenner developing Kardashian kids spin-off?

Reality TV star Kris Jenner is reportedly working on a new spin-off show about her grandchildren called "Keeping Up with the Kids".

The show will focus on Kourtney Kardashian's children Mason, Penelope and Reign, Kim Kardashian's kids North and Saint, as well as Rob Kardashian's unborn baby, reported Female First.

Jenner's concept for a next generation spin-off has reportedly ignited a "family war" as son-in-law Kanye West has no plans on letting his two kids participate.

"Kanye went ballistic when he heard the idea and went straight over to Kris' house to confront her," an insider shared, "He accused her of trying to exploit North and Saint."



While Jenner is willing to wait until the kids are older to film the series, West is said to be completely against it.
