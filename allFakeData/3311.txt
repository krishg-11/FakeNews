Bruce Jenner horrified by Kim Kardashian for dragging North West like an accessory

Bruce Jenner is reportedly upset that American reality television star Kim Kardashian is treating her daughter North West like an "accessory."

According to Hollywood Life, the 65-year-old former Olympian is against the 34-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star taking the 19-month-old toddler around the world, including in the front row at fashion shows.

"He wants North to be a kid. To go to kid things," an insider said. "She has no business being at a fashion show and he's appalled that Kim sometimes drags her around like some sort of an accessory."

"He doesn't appreciate how every time he turns around he sees his granddaughter's face plastered on magazines and websites. He hates it and doesn't want her to be exploited the way she is," the source added.

This comes after North threw tantrums twice during the New York Fashion Week.

The tiny tot burst into tears at father Kanye West's show with Adidas and the toddler also cried at the Alexander Wang runway show.

Meanwhile, it was previously reported that Kardashian feels North should not be banned from attending high profile events just "because she's a baby".
