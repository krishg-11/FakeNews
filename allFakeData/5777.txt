Kanye West Tells Khloé Kardashian to Dump Tristan Thompson

It seems like everyone is hoping Khloé Kardashian will eventually dump her cheating baby daddy Tristan Thompson, and that includes brother-in-law Kanye West! When KoKo gave him a call to wish him a happy birthday on June 8, he took the opportunity to beg her to dump her baller beau, a source told In Touch exclusively.

“Kanye’s received Happy Birthday phone calls from everyone in the Kardashian family, but it turned ugly when he talked to Khloé and told her to stop dating basketball players," the source explained. While Kanye tried to be as nice as possible by explaining that she was "too pretty and too smart to be with a man who's proven he’s going to cheat for life," she was pissed.

"He asked how many times does she want to be heartbroken," the insider continued. "Obviously Khloé was offended and gave Ye a piece of her mind." However, the source said she didn't "go in on him too much" because it was still his special day.

Yeezy definitely has a sore spot when it comes to ballers (Kim married one before him, after all) an he even rapped about Khloé's situation on his new album, Ye. “All these thots on Christian Mingle, that’s what almost got Tristan single. If you don’t ball like him or Kobe, guarantee that b—h gon’ leave you," he said, which made it seem like he thought KoKo was only staying with TT because of his career.

Yeezy thinks that Khloé staying with Tristan will give her younger sisters the wrong idea. "He told Khloé that her sister Kendall is looking up to her and that by getting rid of Tristan she’d be setting a strong example," said the source. Kendall already seems to be dating her own baller, 76ers player Ben Simmons. Hopefully Kanye can learn to tolerate Tristan as long as Khloé has decided to give him another shot!
