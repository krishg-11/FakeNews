Golden Globes 2018 winners: the complete list

The 2018 Golden Globe Awards, hosted by Seth Meyers, kicked off Hollywood’s annual awards season on Sunday, January 7, with several strong statements in support of the #MeToo movement, as well as the usual mix of expected, surprising, and flat-out weird winners in both film and television.

In the film categories, the big winner was Martin McDonagh’s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri which took home four awards: Best Motion Picture — Drama, Best Screenplay, Best Actress in a Motion Picture — Drama (Frances McDormand), and Best Supporting Actor (Sam Rockwell). Lady Bird, directed by Greta Gerwig, was also a notable winner; it took home two awards, for Best Motion Picture — Comedy and Best Actress in a Motion Picture — Comedy (Saoirse Ronan).
