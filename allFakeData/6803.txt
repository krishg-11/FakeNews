Have We Reached the End of Our 3,600 Word Jelena Timeline?

So. Much. Drama.

Every relationship has its ups and downs, but when we’re talking about Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez, that’s approximately seven years of roller-coaster emotions.

The two sparked dating rumours in 2010 and captured the hearts of both their fan bases, resulting in the #Jelena hashtag. Since Bieber and Gomez are two of the most famous young stars of their time, their admirers range from supportive to downright obsessive.

Their relationship is kind of very hard to follow, but luckily, we’ve broken down every single one of their breakups and makeups. Grab a snack, because there’s a lot to dive into.

Rumours that Gomez has dumped the Canadian pop star begin to surface, after a Bieber fan claimed she had sex with him backstage at a show in October 2010, and that he is the father of her 4-month-old child. However, it’s confirmed that the breakup rumours aren’t true.

Don’t go anywhere, this is just the first of many breakups. After more than a year of puppy love, the two reportedly split for the first time as a result of their jam-packed schedules. Fans (and the internet) also begin to wonder whether there’s a relationship brewing between JB and Victoria’s Secret model Barbara Palvin. Palvin took to Twitter, confirming that there was nothing going on between her and Bieber.

January 2016: Bieber and Baldwin hang out on New Year’s Eve

August 2016: Sofia Richie posts an Instagram of her and Bieber

Yes, Sofia Richie, daughter of Lionel Richie, and sister of Nicole Richie. Bieber and Richie both took to Instagram recently to post photos of their time in Japan. The comments on both their accounts proved one thing for sure: do not mess with Jelena fans.

August 2016: Gomez posts a clip of her singing “Let Me Love You”

So, just when we thought the dust had settled between Jelena, this clip surfaced of Gomez singing DJ Snake’s “Let Me Love You,” which features the Biebs on vocals. An official cover has yet to be released; however, suspicions that it’s coming soon have been heightened as DJ Snake posted a longer version of Gomez’s cover on his Snapchat. I think we can all agree that it’s a little odd of Selena to chose to cover her ex’s song after feuding over his new boo Sofia. But hey, you do you, Selena!

November 2016: Bieber allegedly visits Gomez in rehab

Gomez pulled out of her Revival Tour, in late August, due to complications caused by Lupus; mainly symptoms surrounding anxiety and panic. As a result, she checks in to rehab facility (feel better soon, Selena!). Rumours of Bieber visiting Gomez in rehab have started to circulate. Can somebody seriously loop us in, please?!

January 2017: Gomez and The Weeknd spotted together

The 24-year-old songstress was spotted making out with Canadian singer The Weeknd in photographs released by TMZ. According to the celeb news site, Gomez and The Weeknd (real name: Abel Tesfaye) were “getting handsy and mouthy” outside Giorgio Baldi restaurant in Santa Monica, Calif. They then made it Instagram official (sort of) during a trip to Italy where the pair were spotted wining and dining (and kissing, duh!) in Venice and Florence.

February 2017: JB and The Weeknd begin to feud

While out in Los Angeles, Bieber was asked by paparazzi if he would listen The Weeknd’s music, to which he responded with a simple “Hell, no.” Fast forward to Valentine’s Day, when a track called “Some Way” by Toronto rapper Nav, featuring The Weeknd drops. “I think your girl / think your girl / fell in love with me,” the singer croons. The song also delves into NSFW territory: “She say my fuck and my tongue game a remedy.” Yikes! A day later, DJ Kygo’s single “It Ain’t Me” drops, featuring Gomez, and let’s just say the lyrics appear to allude to a certain former flame. Serious. Drama.

April 30, 2017: Selena reportedly pens a JB diss-track

The Sun reports that Gomez and singer/songwriter Charli XCX have collaborated on a track titled “Bad Girlfriend.” The British tabloid speculates that the song is about Justin Bieber, and states that a source has told them that it’s “…about a boyfriend the girl is no longer really into and has finally gotten wise to.” One of the alleged lines, according to The Sun is: “I know I’m not there for you or there when you call. I’m a bad girlfriend/I’m a bad girlfriend.” So. Much. Shade.

May 2017: Selena promotes new single on Instagram

Last week, Gomez took to her Instagram to tease fans with news of her upcoming single. The singer posted a trio of highly-stylized (read: dark, moody) images featuring the words “Bad Liar” scrawled with lipstick on a mirror. As a result, many are speculating that the song must be about her (surprise!) infamous ex-boyfriend. What we can confirm is that the track is scheduled to drop May 18.

June 2017: Selena compliments Justin on a radio talk show.

During an interview on Sirius XM’s Morning Mash Up, ​Selena was asked ​to share ​her thoughts on Ariana Grande’s #OneLoveManchester benefit concert​. Turns out ​she had nothing but ​good things to say about the performers, including Justin.

“It was beautiful,” says Selena. “I thought everyone did such a beautiful job. It was so gorgeous. I love how she [Ariana] ended it. I thought Justin did great. It was really beautiful.” Cue the wild screams tweets from Jelena fans.

June 2017: A Selena and Justin duet reportedly leaked on Soundcloud

The two recorded an incomplete single called “Steal Our Love” back in 2013/2014 before their final breakup. While the song is no longer available to listen to (it was leaked and then swiftly taken off of Soundcloud), the Jelena fans over at Elle has kindly provided us the lyrics. And judging from the lines, the songs tells the story of two people in a troubled relationship who are fighting to make it work.

“I can’t seem to choose what to do / There’s nothing I can say / I’m tired of the fight ’cause I’m never right / I just wanna cry, no,” Selena allegedly sings.

Sounds familiar?

August 2017: Justin releases a new song titled “Friends”

“Can we still be friends?” Bieber asks on his latest track with Bloodpop. He’s singing to to an ex who he swears he’s over but can’t quite completely, and (obviously) fans assume he’s singing to Selena. The plot thickened when people started realizing that Julia Michaels, a good friend of Selena, co-wrote the single. Hmmm…could this be the start of a healthy post-romance friendship?

August 2017: Nude photos of Justin are posted to Selena’s Instagram

With 125 million followers, Selena Gomez is the most followed person on Instagram. So when hackers posted nude photos of her ex-bf to her account, a LOT of people noticed. When Selena’s team clued in, they swiftly took down her page to remove the NSFW photos and re-secure her account. Gomez’s Instagram was back online minutes later, with the nude pics deleted.

The explicit photos posted aren’t new: these are the same Bieber images that were published after the pop star’s Bora Bora vacation in 2015. Obviously, that doesn’t make it okay—we should never look a someone’s naked body without their consent.

October 2017: Justin and Selena spotted hanging out at Gomez’s home

Looks like Bieber’s song “Friends” really was about Selena! At the end of October, Justin was spotted at his ex-girlfriend’s home in California. According to TMZ, Jelena spent time with mutual friends, and Selena’s current boyfriend, The Weeknd, was fully aware of the hangout. TMZ also reports Justin and Selena first reconnected around the time Gomez announced she’d undergone a kidney transplant. All’s well that ends well!

October 2017: Justin and Selena go to church together

It was Sunday Funday for Jelena, with the former lovers spending the full day together on Oct. 29, 2017. According to TMZ, Justin and Selena first attended church service together before grabbing a bite to eat at Joi Cafe in Westlake Village, California. The exes reportedly left together, and Biebs showed up at Selena’s doorstep later that evening. A Sunday well spent brings a week of content!

October 2017: Selena is single, and Justin is THRILLED

Sound the alarms! According to a source via People, the “Sorry” singer is “happy Selena is single. He hopes to regain her trust so they can get back together.” According to Bieber’s “close friend”/wingman, “It seems their relationship now is very different. Justin is certainly a much better person. He would be a better boyfriend, too.” Maybe Justin’s song “Friends” wasn’t about Selena after all…

November 2017: Justin and Selena get pretty cozy

Well these two aren’t wasting any time are they? Jelena hung out in L.A. AGAIN the morning of November 1: They’re biking, they’re laughing, they’re nuzzling into one another, and it’s ALL going down in front of photographers. It’s not PDA, but it’s pretty close. All we need now is an Insta official pic from @justinbieber or @selenagomez.

November 2017: Selena wears Justin’s hockey jersey

Selena Gomez wearing Justin Bieber's hockey jersey is the Canadian equivalent of getting engaged, right? pic.twitter.com/Xr3SdQTSfq — Erica Steiner (@SendARavenPlz) November 2, 2017

Okay, so it’s not a PDA social media post — but it’s pretty close! Selena arrived at the LA Vallet Ice Centre in an all-black ensemble, and after cheering on her ex (?!) boo, left the building wearing Beiber’s New Jersey Devils hockey jersey. Isn’t the ‘borrowed-from-a-boy’ look the international indicator of love?

November 2017: Jelena is kissing in public again

Guess it’s not too late to say sorry for #SelenaGomez and #JustinBieber 💕 #Jelena A post shared by FASHION Magazine (@fashioncanada) on Nov 16, 2017 at 9:45am PST



This is the PDA confirmation we were waiting for! TMZ has shared photos that show the pop singers sealing the deal with a rink-side kiss at one of Justin’s hockey games. To all those who doubted Jelena: we told you so.

November 2017: Justin likes then unlikes a pic of Selena on Instagram

Justin Bieber unliked https://t.co/vJbNYlFKRz — Selena Gomez Source (@GomezSource) November 20, 2017

Trouble in paradise already? Fans freaked out after they noticed Bieber liked a photo of Selena on Instagram, only to unlike it a few minutes later (“Their whole relationship in a nutshell,” remarked one clever Twitter user). Granted, the photo wasn’t actually posted on Gomez’s account but rather a fan account meaning Biebs (who currently doesn’t follow Selena, nor does she follow him) is resorting to exploring the ‘gram for pics of his lady.

In other news, the “Wolves” songstress quietly unfollowed ex-boyfriend The Weeknd on Instagram, and he later followed suit. And now we wait for the real indicator of the relationship status of Jelena: the duo hitting the “Follow” button on each others’ accounts. Stay tuned.

December 2017: Justin is asked if he’ll propose to Selena

Justin Bieber Smiles, Blushes When Asked If He'll Propose to Selena Gomez https://t.co/ad4u4sGJ3f — TMZ (@TMZ) December 6, 2017

In a video captured by TMZ , a paparazzi is heard asking Justin if he plans to get down on one knee to propose to Selena. The Biebs didn’t get a straight answer, but he did flash a wide grin and blush at the question as he got into his car. That’s something, right?

December 2017: Justin and Selena will spend Christmas apart

According to a recent report from People, Gomez’s family is less than supportive about her reunion with Bieber, and won’t be inviting him their family Christmas. “Justin’s family always loved Selena,” a source told the Magazine, “but Selena’s family is still not happy about her seeing Justin.” Selena, on the other hand, will always be welcome in Stratford, Ontario: “I’ve met her and we have a special bond, so I think she’s precious,” Beiber’s mom, Pattie Mallete, gushed to People over the weekend.

December 2017: Biebs and Selena share a drink at the Sugar Factory

They may not be spending *actual* Christmas together, but Justin and Selena are making sure to enjoy each other’s company pre-holiday festivities. According to TMZ, Jelena went on a date at the Sugar Factory, sharing a (non-alcoholic) drink called the Ocean Blue. How romantic!

The drama continues! TMZ reports Jelena is in Christian’s couples therapy after the pair had a fight over Justin’s ex, Hailey Baldwin. According to sources connected to Hillsong Church, Bieber has been trying to make amends with Baldwin to “clear the air over their brief relationship and sour breakup.” He informed Selena of the the convo, which didn’t go over too well, resulting in the pair going to therapy.

January 2018: Justin poses on Instagram with a tree

Trouble in paradise? While vacationing somewhere tropical, Justin posted a photo cuddling up to a palm tree with the caption, “Now I know what Love is.” Fans panicked: What does this mean? Did he not know what love was like when he was with Selena? Does he love the tree more than Selena? J-14 is convinced the caption is about his love for Jesus. (Interesting.)

February 2018: Jelena spotted making out amidst break-up rumours

just seen Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez cuddling in the middle of the street:))) — 🍑 (@hennessyysilvaa) February 9, 2018

Phew! No worries Jelena stans, the couple is going strong. When Bieber and Gomez attended the Rex Orange County show in Los Angeles, one fan got footage of what appears to be them cuddling in the street, while several others tweeted about seeing the two after the show. Here’s hoping the duo share their Valentine’s Day plans with the rest of us, and that they finally make things Insta-official?

February 2018: The pair indulge in a Laguna Beach Valentine’s staycation

With Gomez in New York for Fashion Week, it appears that the newly reunited couple won’t be spending Valentine’s Day together. But don’t fret Jelena stans! Because from the looks of things, Gomez and Bieber enjoyed a romantic staycation on the West Coast this past weekend in celebration of the holiday. TMZ reports that the duo were hanging poolside at the Montage hotel in Laguna Beach on Sunday, where they were spotted taking romantic beach walks and taking in the view.

February 2018: Jelena heads to Jamaica for a family wedding

Bieber and Gomez have landed in the Caribbean for a wedding — but don’t freak out yet, because it’s not their own. Justin’s dad Jeremy is tying the knot in Jamaica with longtime girlfriend Chelsey Rebelo, and the “Sorry” singer is bringing along Selena as his plus one. It’s a pretty big relationship step to take someone as a date to your parent’s destination wedding, right? These two are just as serious as we thought.

March 2018: Selena Gomez posts a b-day tribute to her boo

This is the moment we’ve been waiting for! It’s not the PDA-filled couple selfie we were hoping for, but at least it’s something! It’s sweet, subtle — and kind of meta? It’s a photo of a photo of Selena Gomez with a photo of Justin Bieber on her forehead. The caption: “March 1, 1994 someone I know that happens to be super cool was born. Boom.” Well said. There’s no better birthday gift than an Insta-official relationship.

March 2018: Sources say Jelena is taking time apart

Just six days after making their relationship Instagram official, rumours have started circulating that the on-again couple are taking a break. An unnamed source told E! that after spending so much time together in Jamaica, Gomez and Bieber “were having a lot of little disagreements recently and one fight in particular blew up and caused them to decide to ‘break up.’ However they’ve been in contact the entire time and their feelings for each other have not changed.”

But don’t worry too much Jelena shippers: “They will absolutely get back together and they are not over,” says the source, “but they both need some time away from each other.”

March 2018: Justin Bieber is spotted hanging out with another woman

To cope with the break, Selena Gomez has taken off to Australia with her ukelele. Bieber has another approach to heartbreak: hang out with a beautiful blonde Sport’s Illustrated model. According to Entertainment Tonight, the mystery girl is Baskin Champion, younger sister to Abby Champion, actor Patrick Schwarzenegger’s GF. Champion and Bieber attended Craig David’s concert together in Los Angeles Tuesday night, where sources say Bieber had his “arm wrapped around her waist during one song, and she was spotted dancing up on him throughout the show.”

March 2018: Justin and Selena have reportedly called it quits — for good

Grab your tissue box: it looks like Jelena’s “break” has turned into a break-up. Reports say that Bieber is holding out for a reunion, but “Selena realized even though he’s made some positive improvements, they just aren’t a perfect match right now,” a source told E! News. The bad news gets worse, because the source also said that the two aren’t talking anymore (cue the Charlie Puth x Selena Gomez song.)

Fans think Gomez’s latest outfit — a pair of itty-bitty Daisy Dukes and a yellow t-shirt that read, “Never underestimate the power of a woman” — is hinting at the heartbreak. But hey, this could very well be message for all men!

April 2018: Sources say Justin wants Selena back

Not all hope is lost! According to a new report from People, Bieber desperately wants Gomez to take him back.“He loves her. He wants her back,” the source says, adding he “misses” Gomez. Can these two please just let us know what’s up? This seven year on-again-off-again drama is giving us serious whiplash.

May 2018: Selena has apparently “completely moved on”

Have we reached the end of our lover’s saga? Multiple sources have told E! News that Gomez is over Bieber and not interested in rekindling their romance any time soon. “She respects him as a person but has decided she is much happier doing her own thing.,” said one insider to E! Selena rarely even talks about Justin anymore, and is fully open to dating.” So, is this the conclusion of the on-again-off-again romance? Or has precedent shown us that this is just another bump in the road for these star crossed lovers?

June 2018: Justin and Hailey Baldwin are hanging out again

Ahhh another rekindled love! This past weekend, the once rumoured couple reunited for a few days of bikinis and bibles in Miami. They were photographed drying each other off by the pool, attending a church conference and snuggling on the VIP balcony of LIV Nightclub at Fontainebleau. You know, normal relationship stuff.

July 2018: Justin and Hailey get engaged

After just a month of dating, Bieber popped the big question to Baldwin at a resort in the Bahamas.“Everyone was at a restaurant on the property doing salsa dancing when Justin’s security told everyone to put their phones away,” two witnesses told TMZ, who broke the story early July 8, “because something special was about to happen.”

Have we finally reached the fateful end of our ongoing Jelena timeline? After seven years of drama, maybe it’s what’s best.
