Aaron Rodgers Girlfriend: Is Packers QB Dating Soccer Star Marie Margolius? [VIDEO]

Aaron Rodgers is reportedly moving on from his controversial relationship with actress Olivia Munn with soccer star Marie Margolius.

Following years of rumors which suggested that Munn had led the Green Bay Packers quarterback to be estranged from his family, including brother Jordan Rodgers, who won the heart of Jojo Fletcher on the 2016 season of The Bachelorette, he is said to be enjoying a new romance with his fellow athlete.

Earlier this month, a Page Six report told readers that Rodgers had been spotted on a date with the soccer player at the Martignetti brothers’ Upper East Side hotsplit East Pole.

“They arrived at around 10 p.m. and seemed to be on a date. He wore a baseball cap and asked for the quietest, most out-of-the-way table possible. His hat was tilted down. It definitely seemed like he wanted to be incognito,” an insider told the outlet.

Meanwhile, Munn is reportedly upset about Rodgers' alleged new relationship because he reportedly gave her hope for a future reunion before stepping out with Margolius.

Munn is “in pieces” over Rodgers' new relationship, a source told OK! Magazine on August 28. “Aaron told Olivia he was in love with her but that he needed some space; he promised to stay friends and said they would reevaluate things down the line.”

“But instead he started dating and left Olivia feeling played. To see him move on with someone else in such a public fashion is like a knife through the heart,” the source continued.

“She’s trying to play it cool, but it’s obvious she’s still in love with him,” the insider added.
