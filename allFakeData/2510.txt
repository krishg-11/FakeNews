Justin Theroux and Emma Stone Add Fire to Dating Rumors With a Romantic Day in France

Are Emma Stone and Justin Theroux an item? Rumors of a romance between the two have been going on for a couple of months, and while neither star has confirmed nor denied the claims, they've both been conveniently at the same place at the same time lately. On Tuesday, just one night after both attending the Louis Vuitton 2019 Cruise runway show, Justin and Emma were spotted enjoying each other's company while relaxing on the patio of a house in the small village of Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France. The Oscar-winning actress showed skin in a red one-piece and pants, while Justin showed off his washboard abs by going shirtless. While the could-be couple didn't show any PDA, their closeness and comfort with each other is pretty clear.

Justin has been linked to Emma since early March, after it was announced that he was separating from his wife of two years, Jennifer Aniston, and "pursuing" the La La Land actress. Emma and Justin are starring together in the upcoming Netflix dark comedy series Maniac, and Justin seemed to squash the dating rumors with a photo of them that he captioned "Bffffffs. And yes. JUST bfffffs." Justin and Emma also appeared to leave a Met Gala afterparty together in May, adding more fuel to dating reports. Justin has also been recently linked to Aubrey Plaza, Olivia Munn, model Erika Cardenas, and — most recently — Spider-Man: Homecoming actress Laura Harrier, whom he was spotted swimming with earlier this week.
