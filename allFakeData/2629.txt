When women are abused on screen — and how that shapes opinions about whose stories we believe in real life

“I think that movie is really complex in terms of race and class,” said Shoos. “There’s a scene where Ike abuses Tina in a diner — the cake scene — and there’s a white mother with her kids and they have this horrified look on their faces. One of the things that conveys is: These are black celebrities and there’s a white spectator on screen going, ‘Oh my God, look at what these black people are doing to each other.’ As an audience, we should want to understand how this movie can run into these racist ideas — and we have to be attentive to the fact that this might allow people to dismiss the idea that domestic violence is in fact a larger societal problem because, ‘Oh well, it’s a black musician, he took drugs — what do we expect anyway?’”
