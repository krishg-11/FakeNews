Brad Pitt and Jennifer Lawrence are not dating

While reports that Brad Pitt has moved on with Jennifer Lawrence have been doing the rounds lately, a source close to the actor told DailyMail.com that the news is false. “It is completely false,” the source explained. Lawrence recently split with 48-year-old director Darren Aronofsky, while Pitt divorced Angelina Jolie last year.

An insider from Star magazine earlier reported, “Brad and Jennifer have been enjoying lots of late nights together. There’s an intense connection between them!” The insider added, “Brad has had his eye on Jennifer for years.” Pitt reportedly got the beautiful actress’ number from a mutual friend.
