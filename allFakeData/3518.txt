Solange tweets serious shade at Grammys after Beyoncé snub

Solange Knowles is not taking any nonsense after her sister Beyoncé lost out on the biggest Grammy of the night, Album of the Year, to Adele.

After Adele received the award, she tweeted a link to Frank Ocean's Tumblr post, in which he accused the Grammys of "cultural bias".

Ocean wrote his post in response to an interview with Grammy Awards producers Ken Ehrlich and writer David Wild, in which they claimed the artist's decision to abstain from the ceremony was due to a "faulty" performance in the 2014 Grammys.

In his lengthy note, Ocean criticised the Grammys for giving Album of the Year to Taylor Swift's 1989 over Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly during last year's ceremony.

He said he considered performing at this year's Grammy tribute to Prince, but "then I figured my best tribute to that man's legacy would be to continue to be myself out here and to be successful."

"Winning a TV award doesn’t christen me successful. It took me some time to learn that," he wrote.

"Believe the people. Believe the ones who’d rather watch select performances from your program on YouTube the day after because your show puts them to sleep. Use the old gramophone to actually listen bro, I’m one of the best alive."

"And if you’re up for a discussion about the cultural bias and general nerve damage the show you produce suffers from then I’m all for it."

Ocean didn't submit his two 2016 albums, Endless and Blonde, for consideration, explaining: "That institution certainly has nostalgic importance. It just doesn't seem to be representing very well for people who come from where I come from, and hold down what I hold down."

‘I’d rather this be my Colin Kaepernick moment for the Grammys than sit there in the audience.’
