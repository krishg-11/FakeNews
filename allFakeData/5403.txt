Robert Pattinson Recalls Living With Screech (a.k.a Dustin Diamond)

This is too good. Robert Pattinson phoned in to On Air With Ryan Seacrest on Thursday, August 31, and recalled when he first moved to Los Angeles nearly 10 years ago. The Good Time actor revealed that he lived with Dustin Diamond!

“I met you when I literally had first moved here,” Pattinson told Seacrest. “When I met you I was still living in the Oakwoods apartment [in Burbank, California] … with Screech — with Dustin Diamond — I loved it. I really miss it.”

Fellow celebs such as Neil Patrick Harris, Michelle Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Jessica Biel and Christina Ricci also reportedly once lived at the housing facility.
