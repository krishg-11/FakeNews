Kendall Jenner pictured kissing Gigi and Bella Hadid's brother Anwar

Kendall Jenner has been linked to NBA star Ben Simmons in recent weeks.

But on Monday night the 22-year-old supermodel seemed to have eyes for another fellow - Anwar Hadid, the 18-year-old younger brother of her best pals Gigi and Bella Hadid.

DailyMail.com has obtained an image of the two kissing at a CFDA after party held at Socialista in New York City.

Though her face could not be seen, the hairstyle was the same; and the clothing - a white blouse with black bicycle shorts - was also a match.

Jenner also shared a photo of his hands that evening - he has several tattoos. One says 'I love you angel' and another states: 'ODXX 22.' He had chipped black nail polish on and several silver bracelets.

For the past year, Anwar has been dating actress Nicola Peltz, who was not the CFDAs.

The couple was last seen together in public in early May at a Prada event in NYC. According to TMZ, they split soon after that.

Kendall and Anwar have been friends for the past several years, often attending the same parties in New York and Los Angeles.

Earlier she was at a dinner party at Cipriana with Kaia Gerber, 16. They have become even better friends in the past year.

She also mingled with sister Kourtney Kardashian, Stephanie Shepherd and Simon Huck.

The dinner party looked to be private.

Kaia, who wore Alexander Wang, held up a glass filled with a pink drink as she smiled at Kendall. The ladies had a bread basket in front of them as well as several water glasses.

Inside the awards show, Kendall wore a lovely lavender dress that flashed her legs.

Sister Kim looked radiant in a crop top and thin skirt with large gold bracelets and heels.
