Meghan Markle’s Old Resumé Lists ‘Stripping’ As One Of Her Many Talents

When Prince Harry announced that he would be marrying American actress, Meghan Markle, the world questioned her suitability. Not only had the 36-year-old actress been married once before, but she’d also had some rather questionable acting roles which cast a shadow of judgment over her royal eligibility.

However, the concerns quickly melted after Prince Harry and Markle gave their first interview together. It was evident that the two shared a strong connection, despite only having been dating for 16 months.

But now, it would appear that their mutual love for one another isn’t the only thing they share in common. In an unlikely reveal, it would appear that the ginger prince and the Suits actress also have a shared interest in stripping.

According to TMZ, who have access to a copy of Markle’s old resumé, the future duchess listed some rather unconventional talents and skills. The brunette beauty, who once posed as a briefcase girl on Deal or No Deal, claimed to be good at many sports, including basketball, golf, swimming, horse riding, snowboarding and baton twirling.

But, in a strange twist, one certain to make the Queen blush, Markle also stated that she was a talented DJ, juggler, masseuse, and stripper.
