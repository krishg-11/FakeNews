It appears Tom Cruise has a lot of demands in Hollywood — including banning questions about Katie Holmes and 10-year-old daughter Suri Cruise.

Rob Shuter exclusively reveals the Scientology superstar made his PR team sift through interview requests in order to avoid talking about his relationship with Katie and Suri.

As Star reported, Tom has gone as many as 1,000 days without seeing Suri due to the ties with his religion and his busy acting schedule.

Watch the video above to find out why Tom’s relationship is only looking to get worse with Suri.
