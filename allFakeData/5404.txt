Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth Chumming It Up at Lunch

Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth found a great way to beat the heat, and the silly rumors they're splitting up ... they broke bread together.

Miley and Liam were spotted together Thursday on a lunch date at Aeirloom Bakery in Toluca Lake. Unclear if they hit up a nearby hiking trail, but good guess is they didn't, based on Miley's footwear. Either way ... they looked pretty relaxed taking a break from the hot and muggy L.A. weather.

Their lunch date comes on the heels of rumors they called it quits because they haven't tied the knot. But, as TMZ first reported ... they laughed off those rumors and are in no rush to walk down the aisle -- in fact, they may never take that walk.
