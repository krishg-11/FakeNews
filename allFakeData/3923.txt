Luke Bryan Jokes Gwen Stefani Is Too Hot for Blake Shelton: Watch





Either Luke Bryan was trying to avoid spilling the beans about his pal Blake Shelton dating Gwen Stefani, or he was genuinely surprised because the country crooner couldn’t believe the news.

While chatting with E! News prior to the 2015 Country Music Association Awards on Wednesday, Nov. 4, Bryan, 39, joked that Stefani is too hot to be dating Shelton. “He didn’t come out about that,” Bryan responded incredulously after being informed about the new couple. “You’re trying to trick me…Pull [it] up online. I need to see where Blake has stated that.”

After trying to wrap his head around the new romance, Bryan, who took home the trophy for Entertainer of the Year, joked: “It can’t be true, because there’s no way Blake could ever score a girl like that. It’s not true.”

As exclusively confirmed by Us Weekly, the two Voice coaches are indeed seeing each other. “Gwen and Blake are longtime friends who have very recently started dating,” her rep told Us earlier in the day.

And according to a source, the 46-year-old No Doubt songstress, who split from husband Gavin Rossdale this past August after 13 years, is in Nashville with her beau to attend CMA afterparties!

Shelton, 39, split from Miranda Lambert in July after four years of marriage. After Lambert won Female Vocalist of the Year Wednesday night, the singer noted in her acceptance speech that she “needed a bright spot this year.”
