Drew Barrymore And Kristen Stewart Enjoy ‘Flirty’ Friendship

Drew Barrymore may be bemoaning her lack of a dating life, but RadarOnline.com has learned exclusively she’s got a welcome distraction in Kristen Stewart.

The Twilight actress, 28, and the Santa Clarita Diet star, 43, have both openly talked about their bisexuality. Now, Stewart, who is in talks for the latest reboot of Charlie’s Angels, has turned for guidance to Barrymore, star and producer of the 2000 film and its sequel, an insider tells Radar.

“Everyone has noticed the chemistry between them,” the source revealed. “(Both) are more than a little flirtatious with each other.”

Apparently so much so that Drew has unofficially joined the project as a mentor, and her bubbly personality is helping bring Kristen, “who can be pretty shy,” out of her shell.

“Kristen never mentions her girlfriend Stella [Maxwell] when Drew is around,” adds the source. “Who knows what might happen during filming?”
