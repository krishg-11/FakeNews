Kanye West's Holiday Photo with Kim Kardashian and Their Kids Looks More Somber Than Joyful

This may be the only holiday card we'll be getting from the famous family this year.

The Kardashians may not have released their annual holiday card this year, but that doesn't mean this famous family isn't in the Christmas spirit. Kanye West just shared a more casual and intimate photo of himself with wife, Kim Kardashian, and their children, North, 3, and Saint, 1.

The rapper shared the pic on Twitter Tuesday, along with the message, "Happy Holidays." The pic doesn't look as cheerful as you might expect from a holiday photo, but it's definitely glam enough to fit right into a major fashion magazine.

It's unclear where or when the photo was taken, but it's likely that it was during Kris Jenner's annual Christmas Eve party, which Kanye and Kim both attended, and she was seen wearing the same gold gown. Most of the Kardashian-Jenner fam were also at the bash, including Khloe Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian, Kendall Jenner, Kylie Jenner, and Caitlyn Jenner, according to Us. John Legend, Babyface, and David Foster provided the music for the evening.

Kim and Kanye have kept a fairly low profile in recent months following the reality star's robbery at gunpoint in Paris in October and the rapper's reported hospitalization in November. The state of Kim and Kanye's marriage has also come into question recently. But amid all that, it looks like the family has stayed strong as they prepare to say goodbye to 2016 and ring in the new year.

John Legend gave an update on the couple after their difficult few months during a visit to Watch What Happens Live in December. See what he had to say, below.
