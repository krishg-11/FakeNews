Taylor Swift Terrified Her Comeback Means A Breakup With Boyfriend Joe Alwyn

“Aside from when she’s been recording, Joe’s had her all to himself since they got together,” the source told OK! exclusively. “Taylor’s been in the game long enough to know that as soon as her album drops, everything will change for them.”

While the insider says Joe has promised Tay “he’s in it for the long haul,” Taylor has her doubts. “Privately she knows he’s never experienced this level of fame and hysteria,” the insider explained.

“She doesn’t know how he’ll cope with all the publicity appearances, touring, and sharing her with her fans,” continued the source.

“She won’t be surprised if their relationship runs its course in the next three months – but friends say she’s just gun-shy because so many of her other relationships have been ruined by fame,” the insider added.

As OK! readers know, Taylor and Joe’s relationship was first revealed in May. According to The Sun, Taylor rented a flat in London to be close to her British beau and even donned disguises while out on dates to keep their relationship hidden.
