Trump Has No Idea Why the Civil War Happened, Twitter Has a Field Day

President Donald Trump is causing an uproar again this morning after a bizarre interview where he praised President Andrew Jackson and questioned the reason behind the Civil War. His remarks were from a radio conversation with Sirius XM's Salena Zito on Monday morning.

"I mean had Andrew Jackson been a little later you wouldn't have had the Civil War. He was a really tough person, but he had a big heart," Trump said, despite the fact that Jackson was behind Native American removal, the Trail of Tears and owned about 150 slaves.

"He was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War, he said, 'There's no reason for this,'" Trump added. Jackson died in 1845. The Civil War began in 1861.

"People don't realize, you know, the Civil War, if you think about it, why?," he added, seeming to forget the basic curriculum of an American history class. "People don't ask that question, but why was there a Civil War? Why could that one not have been worked out?" Hint: slavery. Another hint: "states' rights."

1 word answer: Slavery. Longer: When Andrew Jackson died in 1845 (16 yrs before the Civil War began), he owned 150 men, women and children. https://t.co/Icg6puG2JZ — Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) May 1, 2017

President Trump doesn't understand why there was a Civil War.



It's because my ancestors and millions of others were enslaved. https://t.co/dFjpbp1pUy — Rep. Barbara Lee (@RepBarbaraLee) May 1, 2017

No one at the time knew that the Civil War/slavery thing was so complicated. — ANNE LAMOTT (@ANNELAMOTT) May 1, 2017

Great, we elected the one 70-year-old white man in America who hasn't checked out a ton of books and movies about the Civil War. — Brendan Hay (@B_Hay) May 1, 2017

Andrew Jackson

1) owned slaves.

2)Trail of Tears

3)Not Sure he would have been able to "work out" Civil War. Being dead 15 years.#Trump — The Marie😎 (@FordMcCartney) May 1, 2017

Too bad Pres. Jackson didn't ride up to Bowling Green/sit down with Frederick Douglass at besieged Nordstroms & figure out Civil War thingy. — John Weaver (@jwgop) May 1, 2017

Andrew Jackson was a slaveholding plantation owner. He also died 16 years before the Civil War began. This Trump answer is CRAY-CRAY. pic.twitter.com/5OCzD0MjPh — Rogelio Garcia Lawyer (@LawyerRogelio) May 1, 2017

Trump says a genocidal slaveowner could have avoided Civil War (which ended slavery) & claims Jackson was upset by the war (he died in 1845) pic.twitter.com/Grzr2Usmxy — Brian Klaas (@brianklaas) May 1, 2017

"Then I sat with President Lincoln and after 10 minutes I understood that the Civil War was not so simple". — operatwitt (@operatwitt) May 1, 2017

Now everyone's #shocked that Trump knows nothing about the Civil War or US History 101. Let's make this easy: Trump knows nothing, period. — John Schindler (@20committee) May 1, 2017
