After another rough spell for the couple, and Miley recently admitting she doesn’t “envision” getting married anytime soon, it appears the power couple are about to call off their engagement for a second time.

A source told US magazine OK!: “When they got back together, Liam thought things would be different, but Miley hasn’t changed at all.

“She’s sobered up but she’s still immature and isn’t ready to commit to spending the rest of her life with one person.

“They do love each other but at this point it’s starting to become clear this relationship simply can’t go the distance.”

Miley and Liam are have tried couple’s therapy according to the magazine, but it hasn’t worked and only led to more fights. Liam is also said by friends to be envious of his brother, Chris, having three kids with his wife Elsa Pataky, but while he’s feeling more and more broody, Miley is not ready to commit to children and wants to focus on her career and having fun.
