#TBT: See Photos of Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian When They Were Friends

It’s been 10 years since Kim Kardashian came into our lives, and we have Paris Hilton to thank. In 2006, reality TV’s original heiress was in need of a closet organizer and a friend who would be willing to tag along on photo ops. Paris turned to Kim and the world shifted a bit on its axis. Kim and Paris were besties-slash-colleagues until 2007, when Kim struck out on her own with Keeping Up With the Kardashians. She has been known to toss Paris a #tbt. As KUWTK fans may have noticed, she still likes an organized closet—but she’s only got time for her own now.
