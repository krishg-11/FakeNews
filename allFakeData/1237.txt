BREAKING: Barron Trump Rushed To The Hospital, Hospital Releases Statement On His Condition

Horrible news are coming from the President’s house while President Trump on Friday began a 17-day stint at his prized golf club in Bedminster, NJ.

Barron Trump has been rushed to hospital with severe pneumonia while on holiday in Bedminster, NJ.

Barron is currently receiving treatment in hospital, reports Fox News.

The 11-year-old sent a Snap to his friends yesterday with a drip attached in his arm along with hospital wrist.

Barron Trump captioned the image: “Not the sort of bangles I usually choose on holiday.”

He also tweeted his friends, saying that he was currently ‘in a wheelchair, connected up to tubes, in a hospital’.
