Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck Expecting Their 4th Child Together Following Surprise Pregnancy Bombshell (EXCLUSIVE)

After it was previously reported that Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner were returning to Turks & Caicos for a second honeymoon, In Touch has now exclusively learned that the actress is expecting her fourth child with her estranged husband.

The unexpected news comes over a year after the couple announced their divorce, and while Jennifer is keeping mum about her pregnancy — she’s only telling close friends and family — Ben is hoping for a possible reconciliation.

“Jen is telling her inner circle she’s having a baby and she’s happy about it, but being cautious about reuniting with Ben,” a source revealed to In Touch. “Ben is hoping another child will bring them back together as a family.”

The couple, who share children Violet, 10, Seraphina, 7, and Samuel, 4, have not yet filed for divorce. Ben previously agreed to go to couple’s therapy following his alleged affair with the children’s nanny. The actor is over the moon about the surprise pregnancy, and wants Jen to make an effort in piecing their marriage back together, but she’s not quite ready.

“It’s important to him that their children be raised in a family with two loving parents who aren’t divorced, but she isn’t there yet,” the source continued. “She just wants to see if Ben is able to keep his promises.”
