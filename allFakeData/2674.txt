A-Rod Has This to Say About Those Jennifer Lopez Engagement Rumors

If you've been waiting with bated breath to watch Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez walk down the aisle, it looks like you may have to wait a little bit longer.

The MLB star cohosted Wednesday morning's Today show alongside Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb and used the opportunity to shut down engagement rumors, E! News reports.

"By the way, we love Jennifer and we noticed she had a ring on. We saw it in the picture. It's so beautiful," Kotb asked as photos from Lopez's 49th birthday celebration displayed on the screen. "I wonder if Alex got that for her for her birthday. Then we're like, what finger is that on? Now we're wondering, what is going on here?"

The pair has been fighting off engagement rumors for months, after the singer had been photographed multiple times with a diamond ring on her left ring finger. So, yes, what's really going on here?

"I did give her that ring. I gave her that ring probably about four or five months ago," the baseball player revealed. "So I got her that ring. She loved it and look how beautiful she looks."

But as for whether or not "that" ring is really that ring, the answer appears to be a resounding no.

"Of course, it has a significance," Rodriguez confessed. "[But] no, we're not engaged. We're not engaged."

Though there aren't any sort of wedding bells in the A-list couple's near future, that doesn't mean that things aren't going well—a fact that Rodriguez attributes to his own maturity.

"To be honest, if this happened when we were in our 20s, it would have never happened. It was just too much craziness. I wasn't mature enough," he said. Then, addressing the audience, he noted, "Boys, we've got to get our dumbness out of the way."
