Kim Kardashian & Kanye West Install Panic Room

Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are pulling out all the stops to keep their family safe after the reality star’s shocking Paris robbery. Now that the duo is getting ready to welcome baby number three, they are doing everything they can to maintain a healthy and stable lifestyle inside their home. According to a Naughty Gossip source, that includes a state of the art panic room!

“Keeping the kids safe is the couples number one priority. After the Paris robbery, everything changed. They have round-the-clock security but that is not enough anymore,” said the insider.

As RadarOnline.com readers know, Kim Kardashian, 33, previously opened up about her anxiety and trauma after her robbery. The ritzy star stopped wearing jewelry, became somewhat of a recluse and changed her lifestyle all to focus more on her family rather than on her prized bling.

“If something bad happens they cannot rely on others for protection and want to be in charge of their own destiny, which is why they installed the panic room,” the source revealed to Naughty Gossip. “It is one of the most advanced in the world. Once they get into the room they will be safe and can call help. The structure is so advanced that even military personal have not yet used this technology.”
