Meghan Markle reportedly finds certain royal rules 'frustrating' to understand

Meghan Markle has said that she knew joining the royal family would bring about some serious changes in her life, but the newly-minted Duchess of Sussex is reportedly still baffled by some of the royal rules.

“She has found certain rules in the royal household difficult to understand, like the fact that the Queen prefers women in dresses or skirts rather than trouser suits, and is often asking Harry why things have to be done in a certain way,” a source told People of the “Suits” star.

Meghan has been quick to adapt to life in Kensington Palace since marrying Prince Harry, 33, in May, though she has ruffled some feathers as she continues to iron out some of the more traditional protocols.

She caught flak last month for crossing her legs while sitting at an event with Queen Elizabeth, and last week made headlines for reportedly telling an Irish senator she was “pleased” that Ireland recently voted to legalize abortion.

It’s policy that members of the royal family do not comment publicly on political issues.

“I think she finds it a little frustrating at times, but this is her new life, and she has to deal with it,” the source told the magazine.

The Duchess, 36, has been viewed by many as a breath of fresh air to the more traditional royal family, as she has long been a vocal advocate for gender equality – her official biography on the royals website even includes a quote of Meghan declaring herself a proud feminist.

Still, not all are proud of her near-seamless transition into royal life – especially not her half-sister, Samantha Grant.

Her fame-hungry sibling tweeted a nasty rant Tuesday bashing Meghan for icing out their father, Thomas, and said Meghan would be to blame if he died.

“How about you pay tribute to your own father?! Enough is enough. Act like a humanitarian act like a woman! If our father dies I’m holding you responsible, Meg!,” she wrote, according to screenshots obtained by TMZ.

“My father is not an embarrassment for loving his daughter! The Royals are an embarrassment for being so cold. You should be ashamed of yourselves @Kensington Royal… Glad you have so much time to gallivant around paying tribute to others while ignoring your own father! How cold can you be and look in the mirror? Harry? I guess I was right.”

Thomas, 73, has taken to the British press multiple times begging his daughter to contact him, as he claims they have not spoken since he did an interview with “Good Morning Britain” in June.

He did not attend her May wedding, as he underwent emergency heart surgery days before and was unable to fly.

Last week, he said he felt his daughter was “terrified” in her new role, and slammed the royal family as “outdated.”

“Why in 2018 are we dressing like the 1930s? Why do they have to cover their knees?” he told The Sun on Sunday. “I’m not blaming Harry or anyone else but they are following rules that don’t make sense to me.”
