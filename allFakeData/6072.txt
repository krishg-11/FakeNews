The most adorable Father's Day messages

In a tribute to Father's Day last year, celebrities graced social media with the sweetest messages to express their love for their dads and partners. We selected some of the cutest to share with you and will make sure to update these when they are inevitably scattered across Instagram this June.

1. Kensington Palace:

Yesterday, Kensington Palace released an adorable photograph of the Royal fathers on Instagram.

Happy Father's Day. Wishing all the fathers out there a very happy day. A post shared by Kensington Palace (@kensingtonroyal) on Jun 18, 2017 at 2:39am PDT

The split photograph features a snap of Prince Charles with young Prince William and Prince Harry from 1997 (top image). The bottom image was taken just last year, when Prince George attended a children's party on the Cambridge's Royal Tour in Canada.

The post reads, 'Happy Father's Day. Wishing all the fathers out there a very happy day.'

2. Chrissy Teigan:

As per usual, Chrissy Teigan graces social media with the ultimate admiration for her husband, John Legend.

'I took this photo right after John won his Tony a couple weeks ago,' wrote Teigan, alongside a cheerful image of John Legend. 'In all our time together (11ish years!!?!?) I cannot believe how much he has grown as a man and a husband. To see him go from big goals to big ideas to big wins and the love of so many makes me so so happy. 10 years ago, I didn't think he could get better, then I got to see him as a father. I don't know how or why Luna, my family and I got so lucky in this life but I will stop questioning and just be grateful. I love you so much, John. Happy Father's Day.'

So, John Legend isn't just a wonderful husband, he seems to be the a super-daddy to his daughter, Luna.

3. The Beckhams:

Victoria Beckham posted a picture of the whole clan in dedication to her husband, David. Doesn't Brand Beckham just melt your heart?

The best daddy in the world!!! We all love u so,so much ������ X kisses from us all x ������������ A post shared by Victoria Beckham (@victoriabeckham) on Jun 18, 2017 at 6:42am PDT

In her post she call's David 'the best daddy in the world!!!' adding, 'we all love u so, so much.' David later responded to his heartwarming messages in a Snapchat where he says 'a lot of love in the house today,' which features a cards from his children, including a handmade one from his youngest child, Harper.

4. Cheryl:

With Cheryl and Liam Payne becoming first-time parents to baby Bear in March, Cheryl writes a gushing message in honour of the One Direction stars relationship with his son.

Happy 1st Father's Day Liam.. You are the most amazing daddy and the best example for our son. The way he looks at you says it all. Your relationship melts my heart. You are the centre of his world & We adore you ������ A post shared by Cheryl (@cherylofficial) on Jun 18, 2017 at 8:09am PDT

'You are the centre of his world & we adore you,' she wrote. We imagine that Liam was spoiled by his gorgeous family, as he returned from his promotional tour of America to spend his first Father's Day with his family.

5. Michelle Obama:

The previous First Lady took to Twitter to demonstrate the love that she and the girls have for the man of their house, Barack Obama.

Happy #FathersDay @BarackObama. Our daughters may be older and taller now, but they’ll always be your little girls. We love you. pic.twitter.com/SGZMmXaQ3a — Michelle Obama (@MichelleObama) June 18, 2017

Michelle included a picture of her husband in a loving embrace with their two daughters, saying 'they'll always be your little girls. We love you.' The Obama's are always presented as a close-knit family and this post demonstrates how wonderfully loving they are.

6. Stella McCartney:

The McCartney's had a double celebration yesterday - not only was it Father's Day - Paul McCartney turned 75! Stella posted a lovely messaged on Twitter:

Happy birthday and happy Father's Day dad... I am so blessed to have you in my heart and soul, you inspire every day. I love you x Stella pic.twitter.com/HPJR0BpLmc — Stella McCartney (@StellaMcCartney) June 18, 2017

Stella wrote, 'I am so blessed to have you in my heart and soul, you inspire me every day.' We are pretty sure that the wonderful life of Paul McCartney has inspired many others around the globe too...

7. Jessica Biel:

Jessica Biel shared a loving picture collage on Instagram, featuring pictures of her and her husband, Justin Timberlake; and a photograph of her hubby and their son, Silas. The loving message even included a quote from their little boy, saying 'you are so much cool.'

Her message thanked Justin for his paternal role, 'to my beloved husband, my adventure companion, my road dog, who works tirelessly for this family... I am eternally grateful for you and your love.' Such an adorable message!

So much love!
