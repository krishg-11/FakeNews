People are really excited to see that Meghan Markle's old style is back

Meghan Markle‚Äòs style has evolved dramatically since becoming a duchess ‚Äî she wears midlength dresses and pantyhose, and even rocks a fascinator ‚Äî but she‚Äôs made a surprise return to her roots.

On Sunday, Meghan supported Prince Harry at the Audi Polo Challenge at Ascot‚Äôs Coworth Park Polo Club (on what would have been Diana, Princess of Wales‚Äôs 57th birthday), looking relaxed in a white button-down shirt from J.Crew, black cropped Everlane pants with matching Chanel flats, and a $58 Panama hat (reportedly by Madewell x Biltmore).

The 36-year-old also brought her cross-body bag back to life, an accessory she retired in favor of dainty clutches, which royals typically carry to avoid shaking hands with the public.

Royal watchers loved seeing Meghan going back to her casual roots.

I love seeing her casual, laid back vibe again! ‚Äî Teri Wilson (@TeriWilsonauthr) July 1, 2018

Meghan looks lovely and more importantly happy. üëå ‚Äî Erikk_the_Dane‚Ñ¢ (@Erikk_the_Dane2) July 1, 2018

Although the royal dress code is specific and polo matches are significant events for the monarchy, grassy fields aren‚Äôt forgiving of stilettos, and Meghan was probably mimicking sister-in-law Kate Middleton, who regularly swaps tailored dresses for summery (and affordable) sundresses, jeans, and flats.

Meghan‚Äôs look was consistent with her weekend vibe: On Saturday, to attend the same event, along with pal Serena Williams, she wore a $400 cotton gingham shirt dress by American designer Shoshanna Gruss ‚Äî formerly sold on Amazon for $280 ‚Äî flat sandals from Sarah Flint, and the same hat. Social media compared Meghan to Julia Roberts‚Äòs character in Pretty Woman and according to the Daily Mail, the entire ensemble was sold out in two days.

Prior to royal life, the duchess embodied a breezy style ‚Äî even for her first public appearance with Harry, she wore torn blue jeans from Mother (which the brand reissued due to the ‚Äúinsanely high demand‚Äú) and a white button-down shirt from Misha Nonoo.

However, since her wedding, she‚Äôs been side-eyed by some fashionistas. Social media dismissed her two wedding dresses by Givenchy and Stella McCartney as ‚Äúbaggy.‚Äù And they called the blue-and-white Oscar de la Renta dress she wore to the June wedding of Harry‚Äôs cousin Celia McCorquodale ‚Äúfrumpy.‚Äù

According to the New York Post, Meghan is still honing her wardrobe. ‚ÄúOver the next year, Meghan will have more designers throwing themselves at her, and she will adapt her style,‚Äù British designer Caroline Castigliano told the publication. ‚ÄúIt will be fabulous when she takes everything she learns and ‚ÄòMeghan-izes‚Äô it.‚Äù
