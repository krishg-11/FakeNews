Oscars "In Memoriam": Garry Shandling, Robert Vaughn Among Snubs

Dan Ireland and Doris Roberts were also among the notable names who were left out of the ceremony's video tribute.

The 89th Academy Awards on Sunday paid tribute to notable film industry figures who passed away over the past year with its annual "In Memoriam" tribute, which also featured a moving performance by singer Sara Bareilles.

The video tribute honored screen giants such as Carrie Fisher, Debbie Reynolds, John Hurt, Gene Wilder and Mary Tyler Moore, but several names were left out of the segment. Aliens and Twister star Bill Paxton, who died Saturday, one day before the ceremony, wasn't mentioned, though presenter Jennifer Aniston remembered the actor as she introduced Bareilles' performance.

Among those omitted from the tribute were Garry Shanding, Dan Ireland, Robert Vaughn and Doris Roberts.

The producer and director, who died April 14, 2016, at age 57, most notably helmed 1996's The Whole Wide World and Jolene. Jessica Chastain, who made her feature debut in Jolene, tweeted her disappointment about the omission after the "In Memoriam" segment aired.

Viewers also pointed out that costume and production designer Janet Patterson, who was featured in the segment, was mistakenly identified via a photo of film producer Jan Chapman, who is still alive.

Yep I've double checked. That is Jan Chapman, who is very much alive. https://t.co/w7fIuiQYcr â€” Rhett Bartlett (@dialmformovies) February 27, 2017
