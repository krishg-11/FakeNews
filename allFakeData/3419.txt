Meghan Markle Will Take Over One of Queen Elizabeth's Royal Duties

Now that Meghan Markle is officially part of the British royal family, she's being given more and more responsibility.

Following her solo outing with the Queen earlier this month, it's now being reported that Meghan is about to take over one of Queen Elizabeth's royal duties.

According to The Express, Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex "will welcome those in the Queen's Young Leaders programme to Buckingham Palace this summer, continuing the role started by the Queen during her lifetime of service to the Commonwealth nations."

While the Queen is taking a step back from her role in the Queen's Young Leaders programme, it's clear that she's leaving in very capable hands.

Prince Harry is already the patron of the Queen's Young Leaders, a role that he took on in 2018. The programme aims to recognize the work of exceptional young people and the work that they do within the Commonwealth nations.

Taking on his new job in April 2018, Prince Harry said (via The Daily Mail), "In my new role I will work to support The Queen, my father The Prince of Wales, and my brother William, all of whom know that young people are the answer to the challenges of today."

At the time, he made it clear that he wanted Meghan to join him, saying, "I am also incredibly grateful that the woman I am about to marry, Meghan, will be joining me in this work, of which she too is hugely excited to take part in."
