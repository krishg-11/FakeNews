Kanye West confirms he got addicted to opioids after undergoing lipo suction surgery

"I had plastic surgery because I was trying to look good for y’all," the 40-year-old continued to tell the TMZ journalists.

The star claimed he was insecure about his body shape particularly after his brother-in-law Rob Kardashian was shamed online during that time period.

"I got liposuction because I didn’t want y’all to call me fat like y’all called Rob [Kardashian] at the wedding and made him fly home before me and Kim got married. I didn’t want y’all to call me fat so I got liposuction, right, and they gave me opioids, right, and I started taking two of them and then driving to work on the opioids, right?"

Before he recounted a conversation he had with an assistant or someone in his entourage, "Then my boy, and I’d always ask my boy you know, to hand me—we on tour, give me some weed, blah blah blah, so he had to go give me the opioids and there was talk amongst my camp, ‘yeah he’s popping, yeah he’s popping pills’ right? So when he handed it to me, he said, 'Mr. Ye, you know this is used to kill genius, right?' So I didn’t take it. Two days later, I’m in the hospital. I was taking two pills a day at that time."

Kanye was, of course, talking about his Pablo tour, which was cut short November 2016 due to his hospitalization.

We're glad he has worked on his issues and is in a better place now. You can see the rest of Yeezy's speech here.
