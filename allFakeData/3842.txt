The Hollywood couple apparently separated over the Christmas period after she clashed with Cooper's mum.

And the Russian beauty was said to have grown close to tattooed model Stephen James.

A close friend told The Sun: "Irina thought things were going brilliantly with Bradley and is very upset they ended this way."

They continued: "Bradley's mum and Irina were quite close at the start of last year but the more time they spent together the more they realised that they didn't get on.

"That caused friction between Bradley and Irina as he is very close to his mum and the fact that Irina and her didn't get on put pressure on their relationship.

"Irina is a very strong, beautiful Russian woman who knows what she wants, and perhaps Bradley's mum saw that as something she didn't want for her son."

But now, the A-list duo have been spotted together again and again and most recently in New York.

Irina joined the Wet Hot American Summer actor to dinner with pal and fellow actor Jonah Hill.

The supermodel was dressed down for a change in an all black ensemble and faded jeans.

Her on-off boyfriend was also casual, wearing a thick jacket and sunglasses.

But the weather was far from sunny. In fact, the New York night looked rainy and cold.

Come on Bradley, don't you know to dress for the weather.
