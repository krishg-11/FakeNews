Emma Stone Is on Vacation with Justin Theroux in the South of France

Today in unexpected couples, Emma Stone has been spotted on vacation in the South of France with Justin Theroux.

Since he split from Jennifer Aniston in February, Theroux has been linked to a number of different women, including Selena Gomez, Aubrey Plaza, and Petra Collins.

And now, rumors that Theroux is dating Stone have surfaced after the pair were photographed vacationing together at Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc in Saint-Paul-De-Vence, and attending the Louis Vuitton Cruise 2019 show at The Maeght Foundation this week.

Stone and Theroux were also photographed with the actress, Laura Harrier.

Theroux and Stone are co-stars in Netflix's forthcoming series, Maniac, and have been spending a lot of time together as a result. However, rumors that the pair might be more than friends started earlier this month when they were seen leaving a Met Gala after-party together.

E! also notes that Theroux shared a photo of Stone in one of his Instagram Stories earlier this month, as the pair posed with Jonathan Van Ness from Netflix's Queer Eye reboot. Theroux did his best to quell dating rumors, though, captioning the photo, "Bffffffs. And yes. JUST bfffffs."

To make matters more confusing, Theroux was also seen looking extremely close to Harrier, who is on vacation with Stone, and also attended the Louis Vuitton Cruise 2019 show.

Theroux previously shared a photo of Harrier on his Instagram account, taken at a Met Gala after-party. Basically, it's a little unclear whether Theroux is actually dating Stone or Harrier, but you can review all of the photos for yourself over at the Daily Mail.
