Why Selena Gomez is so self-confident

Imagine being in the public eye since the bright-eyed age of seven, wherein every part of your career and personal life become public fodder. Despite the intense emotional toll that this might take on someone, Selena Gomez has managed to navigate a path with grace and has it figured out.

At a mere 25-years-old, the actress-slash-singer is pretty much a confident sage when it comes to body positivity—especially since her life-saving kidney transplant, which she got earlier this year to help with her autoimmune disease called lupus.

“When I look at my body now, I just see life,” Gomez tells Billboard in a recent interview (oh yeah, she just won their ‘Woman of the Year’ award, NBD). “There are a million things I could do—lasers and creams and all that stuff—but I’m okay with it. I don’t have perfect abs, but I feel like I’m wonderfully made.”

“I don’t have perfect abs, but I feel like I’m wonderfully made.”

That’s not to say this self-confidence came easily—especially as she’s facing a newly minted surgery scar (which she admits was “hard in the beginning”). “I remember looking at myself in the mirror completely naked and thinking about all the things that I used to bitch about and just asking, ‘Why?'” she says.

Now, after all that she’s been through (which is a lot), Gomez is feeling all of the positive vibes. “I just keep thinking about how much my body is my own,” she says. “[After the surgery] I had this sense of gratitude for myself. I don’t think I’ve ever just stopped and been like, ‘I’m actually grateful for who I am.’ I do. I didn’t, but I do now.” Hey, everyone should love themselves like a love song (had to).

For more Selena love, this is the super healthy way that Gomez starts her day. And these are her empowering bags that she made in collab with Coach.
