Jamie Foxx Is Reportedly Ready To Wife Up Katie Holmes

Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes have been the subject of dating rumors for years now. The elusive couple has rarely been spotted out together in public, but now they’re reportedly getting ready to take their love to the next step.

Sources close to the couple announced their alleged plans to wed to Radar Online. “They had some struggles after they decided to go public… It changed the dynamic of their relationship and briefly shook Katie’s identity as a proud single mom who didn’t need a man,” the source disclosed.

Opening up about the couple’s alleged plans to get married, the source added, “There’s talk of a small, intimate ceremony, but of course they want to make sure whatever they do goes off without a hitch.” The source went on to allege that the couple was considering tying the knot in Paris and having Holmes' close friend Zac Posen design her wedding gown.

News of Jamie Foxx’s relationship with Katie Holmes comes as a surprise to many due to his relationship with her ex-husband, Tom Cruise. Foxx once referred to Cruise as his “good friend” and even commended the actor on his divorce etiquette during a 2012 interview with Extra.
