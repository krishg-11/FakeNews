‘Big Bang’ Backstage Battles Between Kaley & Mayim

Rob Shuter reports… “Big Bang Theory” stars Kaley Cuoco and Mayim Bialik have been banging heads — and it’s not pretty!

“Kaley and Mayim absolutely hate each other! They’ve had huge catfights, and producers just try to keep them apart,” on-set sources dished.

As earlier reported by The National ENQUIRER, tensions had already flared up in 2016 when Mayim, who was earning $100,000 an episode, said: “We are ALL overpaid!”

An on-set insider dished: “Kaley is furious at Mayim for trash-talking her earnings! She thinks it’s just a case of sour grapes and jealousy.”

Since then, things haven’t gotten any better!

“Mayim doesn’t understand why Kaley hates her,” said the insider.

“She’s tried several times to make peace, but it’s never worked.

“Now she just tries to avoid her!”
