Victoria Beckham and James Corden's Carpool Karaoke Has A 'Mannequin' Twist (Video)

The Internet freaked out this week when Victoria Beckham teased an upcoming "Carpool Karaoke" segment with James Corden. Well, it aired last night ... and it definitely wasn't what anyone was expecting.

Instead of a full blown segment of the two driving around singing Spice Girls songs in the late night host's car, the fashionista was part of a spoof of the 1987 Andrew McCarthy/Kim Cattrall film "Mannequin."

Posh played the title role, starring as a mannequin used backstage on Corden's show who comes to life whenever James is around. As he tries to reunite her with her department store friends, the two hop into his vehicle for a drive to the mall, where they rock out to "Spice Up Your Life."

It's a cute segment ... but left us wanting a full "Carpool Karaoke" with the rest of the Girl Power gang.
