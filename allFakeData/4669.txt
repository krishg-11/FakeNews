Kristen Stewart and Girlfriend Stella Maxwell Move in Together

Kristen Stewart and girlfriend Stella Maxwell have reportedly taken the next step in their relationship by moving in together.

The Twilight actress has been dating stunning beauty Stella, 26, for the past five months and, according to Us Weekly magazine, they are now cohabitating. The publication reports that Stella has moved into Kristen’s four-bedroom house in Los Angeles’ Los Feliz neighborhood, while also keeping her apartment in New York.

“They’re both so busy with work but try to be together when they can,” a source told Us Weekly.

The 27-year-old actress’ romance comes after failed relationships with stars including Robert Pattinson and, since going public with her sexuality, musicians Stephanie Sokolinski and St. Vincent.

The bisexual actress tends to be guarded when it comes to her private life, but after publicly calling out President Donald Trump about nasty tweets he sent about her split from Pattinson in 2012, Kristen has been more open than ever about her sexual preferences.

At the New York screening of her movie Personal Shopper in March (17), Kristen was asked by The Associated Press how she felt about the widespread media coverage regarding her sexuality.

“I’m glad that it’s gotten attention, it matters, it’s important,” she said in a video interview with the news outlet before walking off somewhat stony-faced.

In a previous interview with The Guardian, Kristen added that her experience since coming out has been nothing but positive.

“I mean, it’s hard to talk about. I don’t want to seem presumptuous, because everyone has their own experience,” she explained. “I’m just trying to acknowledge that fluidity, that greyness, which has always existed. But maybe only now are we allowed to start talking about it.”
