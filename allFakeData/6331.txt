Boy George Pays Justin Bieber a ‘Beautiful’ Backhanded Compliment

At one point, Gerber picked up on George’s observation that George Michael was once the “Karma Chameleon” singer’s nemesis, exhorting the performer to “be Justin Bieber‘s nemesis!” Prompting this reply:

“No, he doesn’t need me to be his nemesis. He’s his own nemesis! I feel kind of sorry for him. He’s a kid. Who’s taking care of him? That’s the question I want to ask. Who’s taking care of this child? He’s clearly in a bad place, so I don’t want to slag him off. I think he’s beautiful, a beautiful boy. Let’s not pretend here. He’s a beautiful boy.” “He looks like a beautiful dyke. I kind of like that — the whole dykey, androgynous thing he’s got going on. But I feel like everyone’s giving him a hard time and, yes, he’s slightly out of control. Somebody [should] step in.”

We also have to hand it to Ferber for having the guts to ask Boy George if he’s tried Grindr! BG’s answer: “I wouldn’t want to go out with somebody who puts their penis on an App.”
