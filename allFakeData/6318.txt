Meghan Markle's secret boyfriend Steve Lepore

The princess-in-waiting, 36, is said to have fallen hard for fellow student Steve Lepore while studying at Northwestern University in 1999.

America’s Star magazine claims Meghan still has a place in her heart for handsome Steve, who played for the university’s basketball team.

“They say you never forget your first love, and that certainly holds true for Meghan,” an insider is quoted as saying.

“Steve was older than Meghan, which freshman girls always like; he was a handsome and chiseled 6’5” and a real man’s man – and Meghan fell hard for him.

“They made quite the pair, and all her sorority sisters were impressed that she snared such a hottie.”

While the former couple have both since moved on with other people, the publication asks what Harry would think of his love's secret past romances.

Star went on to document Meghan’s other romances before she met Harry, suggesting the British Royal family could have reason for concern ahead of her presumed imminent engagement to Prince Harry.

The publication cited a separate source as saying, “Clearly, the royal family would be intensely interested in the romantic history of anyone in Meghan’s position. And it’s fair to say they certainly may not view Meghan’s as ideal.”

The couple look really happy to us! Go Meghan!
