CONFIRMED: Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston - 'They're back on!'

According to Star, when Angelina Jolie left Brad’s life, party-loving George was excited to return, having allegedly been shunted out of the actor’s life by a disapproving Ange. And he reportedly relished the opportunity to facilitate a thawing between Brad and his ex-wife Jen.

‘They’ve been secretly getting together for late night hook ups, and it’s all because of George,’ a source told Star.

‘George was the first person to call him when his marriage to Angie imploded. After Jen and Justin Theroux announced their split, he encouraged Brad to reach out and give their relationship another chance.’

According to the magazine, the duo had their first post-slip meet up an March 3 at a private pre-Oscars party in Beverly Hills.

‘The plan was to head over to Jen’s place afterward for a nightcap, but, of course, George would just drop Brad off.’

The magazine claims that Jen was so excited by the idea, that she even went to the extreme of lending George her bodyguard so he could drive the pair to her home.

‘Their evening together was very relaxed and low-key,’ the source told Star. ‘They reminisced about the past and had a lot of laughs. It seems just like old times, only better.’

While Star notes that George Clooney’s rep had denied their story, the magazine goes on to note that Jennifer ‘wants to keep the reunion under the radar’, given that she only announced her marriage split weeks ago.

Neither Brad nor Jen’s reps have yet commented on Star’s story.
