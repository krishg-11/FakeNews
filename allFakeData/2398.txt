Take a look inside Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s lush Malibu home

If you’re set to marry royalty, like Meghan Markle you would expect to move into a palace, and live out your Disney Princess fantasy!

Just us?

Well, Meghan will be living on the grounds of Kensington Palace with her hubby to be, Harry after their wedding.

But in an attempt to make sure Meghan isn’t too homesick, they will be spending some time in the States.

And of course, they’re royalty so they won’t just be renting out an AirBnB when they spend time.

According to New Idea, the couple will spend at least four months in the US and have ‘fallen in love’ with the Italian-style 8-bedroom property which has an ocean view.

The house is currently on sale on Sotheby’s International Reality for a massive $16 million or around €13 million! So what comes with that price tag?

The house includes eight bedrooms, eight bathrooms, a swimming pool, a hot tub, a home cinema, koi ponds, waterfalls, oh, and it’s very own private beach. Are you able?

‘It’s everything Harry and Meghan could want – and it’s perfect for when they have kids,’ a source told the publication.

Oh and not only are they splashing the cash by buying it, they also intend on spend an extra $1 million to decorate it to their own taste!

The couple want to spend time in Malibu because it means that Meghan can see her family and friends a lot. According to the source they want Meghan’s mum to move into the guest house so she can have the run of the place when they’re in the UK.
