Mariah Carey & Lionel Richie Tour Disaster

Mariah Carey joined forces with Lionel Richie for what was supposed to be a monster tour, but fans aren’t flocking to their shows — causing tickets to be reduced from $140 to a paltry 30 bucks!

“Lionel and Mariah’s show was meant to be a blockbuster summer tour, but it’s turning out to be anything but,” one insider told The National ENQUIRER‘s Rob Shuter.

“With ticket sales this slow, they will be lucky to break even!”

“His fans are not into her, and her fans are not into him — $140 is a lot of money to spend for basically half a show from the artist you want to see.

“Trust me, these two won’t be touring together again — they might not even be speaking after this.”
