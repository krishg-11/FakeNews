Only Fools and Horses is returning with a very special guest star - David Beckham.

The legendary sitcom - which stars original actors Sir David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst - will return for this week's Sport Relief special with former footballer Becks taking a starring role.

Beckham, 38, recently revealed that he was nervous about starring in the sketch.

"The day of filming started off with a slightly sleepless night, going over my script," he said.

"The thought of being on set with Nicholas and David was obviously very nerve-wracking."

During the scenes, Becks is seen in a baseball cap and glasses while Del Boy will be in his familiar sheep-skinned coat.

Becks has taken part in several sketches for the charity over the years, including cuddling up in bed and sharing a bath with actor James Corden in 2012.

In other Only Fools news, Sir David Jason explained how he developed the Del Boy character on last night's Michael McIntyre Chat Show.
