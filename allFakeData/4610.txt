Scott Disick is being DNA tested for the paternity of Kylie Jenner's baby

Right after Kylie Jenner gave birth to Stormi, whose father we ASSUMED was Travis Scott... her ex Tyga demanded a paternity test.

Although the pair were broken up when Kylie fell pregnant, he was sure there could be a chance that the baby was his.

HOWEVER. Things just got even more freaking insane, because reports are now coming out that Scott Disick is being tested too. According to OK! an insider has revealed that it's a possibility. "He [Scott] and Kylie were rumoured to be an item once, so he's not off the list."

Um.

According to the mag, Kris Jenner isn't taking any chances on who the father could be, and "wants the candidates to take paternity tests."

This is just an image we wish never got into our heads, tbh.
