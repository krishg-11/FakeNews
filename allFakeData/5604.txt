New Reports Claim Kendall Jenner Is Quitting 'Keeping Up With The Kardashians' To Move To Paris

“Kendall’s been done with the cheesy PR stunts for some time,” the insider spilled. “She’s fearful it’ll hold her down if she doesn’t distance herself now, while she’s on top in modelling.”

Understandably, Momager Kris Jenner is not at all pleased with Kenny's plan, but something tells us that won't stop the stubborn 21-year-old.

“She knows people look at her and snicker because of her family and it bugs her," added the source. “Kendall adores her family but figures it’s death by association, if she’s not careful."

According to the source, Kendall “wants to be phased out as soon as possible.”

Go on Kris, throw some money at the problem. KUWTK won't be the same without our girl!
