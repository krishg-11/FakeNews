Mariah Carey's New Year's Eve Mishap NOT Caused By Drugs And Alcohol, Despite Report

Mariah Carey’s botched New Year’s Eve performance was NOT caused by drugs and alcohol, despite a bogus tabloid report. Gossip Cop can exclusively debunk this claim. We’re told it’s not true.

According to the National Enquirer, the singer’s friends fear she’s headed for a meltdown following the New Year’s fiasco, during which technical difficulties interfered with Carey’s set. A so-called “source,” however, tells the magazine that the singer mixed a combination of booze, prescription medications and marijuana prior to going on stage in Times Square, which caused her to fumble her performance.

“Mariah seems to be paranoid and delusional, thinking that everyone is out to get her,” says the magazine’s dubious insider. Of course, sound problems and Carey’s earpiece malfunctioning were the real cause of her bungled performance, but Gossip Cop still checked in with a source close to the singer to get to the bottom of the drug and alcohol allegations. We’re assured that Carey wasn’t impaired on New Year’s and her friends aren’t worried about her well-being, nor would they talk to the Enquirer about it in the first place.

Unfortunately, we’re not surprised by the magazine’s inaccurate story. Back when the singer was engaged to James Packer, Gossip Cop called out the Enquirer for falsely alleging Carey’s engagement ring was fake. There was no truth to that report, and the same goes for this latest one.
