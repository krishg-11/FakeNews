Scarlett Johansson Dating Colin Jost? They Made Out & Talked All Night After ‘SNL’

Do we have a hot new couple on our hands!? Newly single Scarlett Johansson packed on the PDA with ‘SNL’ star, Colin Jost, at an after-party on May 20, according to a new report. Could she be rebounding from her divorce with the comedian!?

Scarlett Johansson showed up for the cold open of the May 20 episode of Saturday Night Live, and she stuck around for the after-party! The actress joined the show’s cast and crew for the season finale party at 30 Rock, and reportedly got quite cozy with “Weekend Update” host, Colin Jost. “Scarlett and Colin were making out at the bar at the SNL season finale party,” an insider told Page Six. “They would make out a bit, then go back to talking. They were at the bar in front of everyone. They made out at least twice, then they went back to talking and hanging with other people.”

In January, it was reported that Scarlett and her husband, Romain Dauriac, had separated after just over two years of marriage. Then, in March, she officially filed for divorce. The pair have attended events together in the months since the split, but if this PDA report is true, it definitely seems like ScarJo is moving on! “Scarlett and Colin were flirting and canoodling in full view of everyone at the after-party,” another source confirmed to the paper. “They were laughing and seemed to really hit it off.”

As HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY reported, Scarlett wasn’t looking to waste any time when it came to getting back into the dating pool. “She is not going to wait until her divorce is complete,” an insider told us EXCLUSIVELY. “She is going to live her life. She will certainly date and has no problem doing it sooner than later.”

HollywoodLifers, do you think Scarlett and Colin would make a cute couple?
