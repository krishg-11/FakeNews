Justin Bieber And Selena Gomez Are Reportedly Planning To Elope

So now that the Biebs has the love of his life back, he is reportedly keen AF to make it official by tying the knot and Sel is totally down with it.

Oh.

My.

God.

An insider told Life & Style magazine that “they’re making plans to get married and start a family as soon as possible.”

“Selena’s health scare has given her more reason to live than ever. She doesn’t want to waste another precious second."

The source adds that while Justin is happy to just elope, Sel wants something a bit more lavish to celebrate their love.

"She wants a wedding — the bigger, the better,” the insider says. “She wants a white dress, thousands of colourful roses and her very best friends for bridesmaids," they said which very well could be referring to Taylor Swift!

“Selena’s [plan] was always to marry in her mid-20s,” one insider reveals to the mag.

“All she cares about is her love for Justin and their future.”

We are absolutely DYING over this news. Now errybody keep your eyes on Sel's ring finger in case they get hitched in secret.
