Gwen Stefani Tells Blake Shelton She Loves Him (Ish)

Before the most recent episode of “The Voice,” Adam Levine and Gwen Stefani took a few moments to talk with “Entertainment Tonight” about what they are thankful for this year and well…it got weird.

When Adam looked at the camera to fake apologize for something he said about Blake Shelton, Gwen looked at the camera and said, “I love you, too, Blake-ish.”

Adam told her it was a dumb thing to say and then Gwen went on a 2-minute spiel about how great Adam is.

The statement comes on the heels of Gwen’s super emotional performance during the American Music Awards and a vague tweet from Blake about the performance.
