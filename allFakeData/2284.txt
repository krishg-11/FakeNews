*The salaries of Hollywood’s biggest stars for 2018 were recently revealed, with Dwayne Johnson, Anne Hathaway, Daniel Craig, Jennifer Lawrence and Vin Diesel taking home the biggest paychecks per film.

But one item in particular, from Variety, stood out:

‘Want access to Johnson’s 104 million Instagram followers? It’s going to cost you. The Rampage star is asking for a $1 million social-media fee as part of his package for the upcoming Red Notice; that includes promoting the film on the likes of Twitter and Facebook.’

According to the report, Johnson will likely be 2018’s highest paid actor due to the volume of movies he cranks out. The same Variety report also looked at his earning power, as Johnson is one of the few celebrities who has managed to cultivate an attentive following on social media, which has resulted in him having over 12 million followers on Twitter and over 100 million followers on Instagram.

Johnson will be paid $22 million for his upcoming 2020 film “Red Notice,” with $1 million of that ensuring he will promote the film on his Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts.

His payday came just behind Daniel Craig, who is reported to receive $25 million for the latest James Bond film.

Anne Hathaway is also set to take home $15 million for the 2020 film “Barbie,” while Jennifer Lawrence took home that same amount to play a Russian spy in “Red Sparrow.”
