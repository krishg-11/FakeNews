Kate Mara Laughs Off Report About Banning Rooney's Boyfriend Joaquin Phoenix from Wedding

Kate Mara and Jamie Bell hold hands while heading into the hotspot Chiltern Firehouse together on Saturday (July 1) in London, England.

The 34-year-old actress and the 31-year-old actor, who worked together on the movie Fantastic Four, are in town following a trip to Paris the week before.

Kate recently responded to a report that claimed she banned her sister Rooney Mara‘s boyfriend Joaquin Phoenix from her upcoming wedding because she allegedly considered him to be a “weirdo.”

“LOL (Ps. I LOVE weirdos),” Kate tweeted in response to the totally false story.
