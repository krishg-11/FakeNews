Ellen Degeneres and wife Portia's $400 million divorce

When the talk show queen spent a whopping US$20 million on a luxury, beach-front, mansion in the sleepy Californian town of Carpinteria, everyone assumed it was just another notch on her property belt.

However, according to reports in Star magazine, Ellen bought the pad because she was in desperate need of somewhere to escape her troubled marriage to Portia.

“Ellen bought the house right after she had a huge blowout with Portia,” a source told the publication, claiming that a recent argument at their Beverley Hills home being “their worst fight yet”.

In fact, Star predicts that their nine-year-marriage is so unstable that they could be heading for a US$400 million divorce.

According the friends of the couple, Portia is sick of playing second fiddle to Ellen’s career and is demanding more attention.

However, the argument only pushed Ellen further away and she ended up storming out and decamping to her bachelorette pad.

“Ellen couldn’t wait to move into her the new house after she closed the deal,” says the insider.

“Friends and family fear that the relationship won’t survive this"

Sources say Ellen and Portia have been living separate lives for some time – with Ellen spotted having lunch with a mystery woman back in June.

“As soon as she finished work, she turns off her phone, retreats into her own little world and doesn’t want to talk to anyone, including Portia”.

Lets hope they can work things out! The couple have yet to respond to Star's report.
