Brad Pitt Finds Sobriety Support From ‘Straight-Laced’ Girlfriend Neri Oxman ‘would not date him if he was drinking or using,’ says pal.

Brad Pitt has his priorities in order — and so does his new girlfriend!

RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that the 54-year-old actor is “still sober,” and that his MIT professor girlfriend, Neri Oxman, is “extremely supportive” of his recovery.

“Brad is sober right now, and Neri would not date him if he was drinking or using,” a source close to Pitt told Radar.

“She is about as straight-laced as they come, and is a huge health fanatic too. Neri is a firm believer that people should not put anything into their bodies that does not belong.”

“She is very against drugs and has been a great influence on Brad.”

As Radar previously reported, Pitt celebrated several months of sobriety in the summer of 2017. He quit drinking after a boozy fight with ex Angelina Jolie led to their nasty split the year prior.

“I was boozing too much. It’s just become a problem,” he told GQ.

Pitt and Oxman’s budding romance is going strong into summer. Us Weekly reports that Oxman will visit Pitt in Los Angeles from her native Boston.
