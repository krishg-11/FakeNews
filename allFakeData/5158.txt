Katy Perry Furious Over Taylor Swift’s Video for “Look What You Made Me Do”

After Taylor Swift premiered her music video for “Look What You Made Do” during the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards, many consider is a power move against rival Katy Perry. Perry hosted the awards, and when it came time to announce Swift’s video, she was no where in sight.

The music video also took digs at Kim Kardashian and Kanye West who had this to say in response during a talk with Interview magazine.

“I’m really aware of what’s going on. If there’s something being said about one of my sisters, I’ll be the first to jump in a group [chat]. We have family chats that happen all day, every day. A lot of us are traveling, so one of us will inevitably wake up at four in the morning to 30 messages. I’ll be the first to jump in and say, ‘Guys, I’m seeing this. This is not cool. Tell me what’s going on.'” -Kim Kardashian

With the release of Reputation coming Nov. 10th., there will surely be more drama to come.
