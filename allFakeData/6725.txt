Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas Living Together

The summer of fast, intense celeb romances continues with Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra reportedly getting move-in-together serious. E! reports that Jonas is already staying in Chopra's apartment this summer. "Nick has basically been living in Priyanka's New York City apartment with her and they spend a lot of time together," the source said. "The next step is him permanently moving in, and it has been a discussion."

General relationship status-wise, the source told E! that "Priyanka and Nick are still very serious," but also that they aren't about to pull a Justin Bieber-Hailey Baldwin and get engaged. "They aren't in a rush to the altar anytime soon," the source said. "They are enjoying getting to know each other, but are definitely still inseparable since going public with their relationship."

They've also become tight with Joe Jonas and his fianc√©e Sophie Turner, who they spent Fourth of July with publicly. "Nick loves doing things together with his brother Joe and Sophie, and the four of them love to hangout," the source said. "Priyanka is a really good fit into the Jonas family." Perhaps more permanently at this rate.
