Ryan Gosling and pregnant love Eva Mendes 'have broken up'

America's National Enquirer claims the Oscar winner, 36, has grown tired of his actress partner’s allegedly controlling and insecure ways.

Following a series of purported fights between the pair that are said to have dated back several months, it’s alleged he’s virtually moved out of their home in suburban LA.

Making matters even more scandalous, the Enquirer reports Gosling has been flirting heavily with his La La Land co-star Emma Stone.

“Ryan hasn’t been around in weeks, and the word is that he’s called it quits,” an insider supposedly told the publication.

“He adores Eva and they’ve tried everything to make the relationship work, but at the end of the day they’re are way too many arguments. They’ve been leading separate lives for months.”

The magazine’s tipster added, “It’s terrible timing, because everyone’s convinced Eva’s expecting another baby. But even that doesn’t look like it can save them at this point.”

Turning to the actor’s purported closeness to Stone, the Enquirer reported: “It’s no secret Ryan and Emma are extremely close, and Eva was totally threatened by their red-hot chemistry.

“Now Emma’s openly admitting she’s single, and people are wondering if that’s the reason Ryan’s distancing himself from Eva.”

Gosling, Mendes and Stone have yet to comment on the Enquirer's sensational report.
