Kylie Jenner & Travis Scott Are "Hands-On Parents" Despite Busy Schedules

Kylie Jenner recently graced the cover of Forbes magazine as the youngest self-made billionaire and Travis Scott just dropped off his anticipated Astroworld album that is getting all the love. Aside from sharing many accomplishments due to them both killing it in their respective fields, they also share a six-month-old daughter, Stormi Webster, and reports say they are doing a great job at parenting despite their busy lifestyle.

"The birth of Stormi has strengthened their bond together as a couple in ways they didn't even realize were possible. Kylie and Travis are both extremely busy but are hands-on parents because they do not want to miss out on anything Stormi does," a source told Entertainment Tonight.

If one of the parents are working or tied up in events, then the other will step in and take over or they bring young Stormi to work if possible. "Although they are Kylie and Travis, they have a very normal life when it comes to parenting. They value their time with her, and also know it's important to get time alone, so the two plan date nights to dinner or movies, or just stay home, and have a family member or friend watch her," the source added.

Apparently, Kylie plans on bringing Stormi to as many shows as possible whenever her schedule and Stormi's sleep schedule allows it.
