Why Kate Middleton DIDNâ€™T join Prince William in Israel - despite growing up in Jordan

The Duchess of Cambridge, 36, has joined Prince William, also 36, on a number of important royal tours such as Canada and India over the years.

As part of the royal family, the couple head abroad to promote good relations between countries in the name of the crown as Queen Elizabeth reduces her overseas visits.

Yet Prince William headed to Israel and Jordan alone last month in a landmark visit and was the first of any British monarch to do so.

Many may not realise that Kate Middleton grew up in Jordan as a child after moving there for a number of years.

However, she failed to join her husband on the trip, albeit for an understandable reason.
