Judd Apatow has spoken out against Quentin Tarantino for not confronting Harvey Weinstein about his alleged mistreatment of women.

“Knew enough since Clinton was President and MC Hammer was selling millions of records. That’s a lot of years to not confront a friend,” Apatow wrote on Twitter on Thursday night.

In an interview with the New York Times on Thursday, Tarantino admitted that he knew of Weinstein’s alleged mistreatment of women years ago but did not do enough to stop it.

In the interview, the director, who worked with Weinstein on basically all his major film projects, said that he’d known about Weinstein’s action as far back as the ’90s but didn’t do anything to stop it, something he admits to regretting.

“I knew enough to do more than I did,” Tarantino told the paper. “There was more to it than just the normal rumors, the normal gossip. It wasn’t secondhand. I knew he did a couple of these things.”

Tarantino owned up to hearing directly from his ex-girlfriend Mira Sirvino and another unnamed actres about their experiences with Weinstein. He also was aware that Rose McGowan, who last week tweeted that Weinstein had raped her, had allegedly reached a legal settlement with him. Despite this, he did not realize that the incidents were part of a larger pattern.

“What I did was marginalize the incidents,” he said. “Anything I say now will sound like a crappy excuse.”

Instead, Tarantino continued to work with Weinstein in the years since, including on Oscar-nominated films “Inglorious Basterds” and “Django Unchained.”

A rep for Apatow declined a request for comment, while Tarantino’s did not respond.
