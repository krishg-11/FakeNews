Heating Up! Brad Pitt Plans Summer Getaway With Professor Girlfriend Neri Oxman The actor and his brainy babe 'are getting very serious,' source claims.

Brad Pitt is getting ready to go public with his top-secret girlfriend, Neri Oxman!

RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned Pitt, 54, and the 42-year-old MIT professor are heading to Europe together this summer.

“Neri is planning a vacation with Brad after this semester is finished,” a source close to the stunning Massachusetts-based brunette said. “She has been on cloud nine!”

“The two were trying to keep their romance under wraps, but Brad is not concerned with being discreet about it anymore,” added the source.

Pitt — who has yet to finalize his divorce from ex-wife Angelina Jolie — has become “infatuated” with Oxman and has even referred to her as the “sexiest woman he’s ever met.”

As Radar previously reported, after the pair were spotted numerous times together on the MIT campus, a source revealed that Pitt and Oxman have been “practically living together” for almost a month in her luxury condo in Cambridge.

“Brad already has the keys to her apartment and they are getting very serious,” a source told Radar.
