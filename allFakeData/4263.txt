Emma Watson Dating Robert Pattinson Following William Knight Split

It’s been less than two months since news broke that Emma Watson split from tech entrepreneur William “Mack” Knight. But she’s already moved on — with Robert Pattinson.

“They’ve been texting and enjoying secret dinners together in LA and London,” a source told In Touch exclusively, explaining that Emma, 27, and Robert, 31, have been friends since they filmed 2005’s Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. “They share the same sense of humor and have so much in common. They’ve always had chemistry, but the timing has never been right — until now.”

The new couple seemingly went public at the 2018 Golden Globes, where they presented the award for Best TV Movie or Limited Series, which went to HBO’s Big Little Lies. As expected, viewers were beyond excited about seeing the pair together on the little screen.

“Harry Potter Vibes with Emma Watson and Robert Pattinson,” one fan wrote before another added, “Anyone else geek out over @EmmaWatson & Robert Pattinson’s #HarryPotter reunion at the #GoldenGlobes?” While Emma has not spoken out about her new romance, she has been very open about dating in the past. “It’s difficult in my dating life because anyone I get photographed with is automatically my boyfriend,” she said. “So it just makes it look as if I’ve had, like, 6,000 boyfriends!” Meanwhile, Robert recently called off his engagement to longtime girlfriend FKA twigs.
