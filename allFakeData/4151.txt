Mamma Mia 2: Amanda Seyfried opens up on working with REAL-LIFE ex Dominic Cooper

The pair fell in love after appearing in the first movie together, back in 2008. Their relationship didn’t last, and Seyfried is now happily married to Tom Sadoski - with whom she has a child. She admitted in a new interview that Sadoski was “jealous” of her on-screen relationship with Cooper, but it’s nothing to worry about. “I think he has the same kind of issues that I would have if we were hanging out with his ex-girlfriend from long ago,” she told The Mirror.

“I think it’s always like, ‘I’m so in love with this person, so that person must be so in love with her too’. “I assume everyone’s in love with Tommy because I’m in love with him. I assume that everybody sees him the way I do.” She added: “I’d guess he assumed Dominic is in love with me the way he’s in love with me. And it’s just not the case. “It’s sweet. I’d rather he be jealous than completely fine with it. He’s been great.

Baranski appeared to fuel rumours that Streep’s Donna is dead in the sequel, as she said at the UK press conference that the key players are all dealing with “loss”.
