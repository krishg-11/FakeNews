Prince Harry’s adorable actress girlfriend Meghan Markle has shut down her lifestyle website, the Tig, where she shared her love of travel and food, along with beautifully shot photos of herself around the world.

The “Suits” actress posted an announcement on Friday on the site, which read, “After close to three beautiful years on this adventure with you, it’s time to say goodbye to the Tig. What began as a passion project (my little engine that could) evolved into an amazing community of inspiration, support, fun and frivolity. You’ve made my days brighter and filled this experience with so much joy.”

The move immediately sparked speculation that her relationship with Prince Harry, whom she has been dating for several months, is becoming more serious, and that she is following royal protocol by becoming more private.

But other sources say she is focusing on “Suits” and her humanitarian work.

According to a source, she and Harry are “very happy” but they are not engaged — yet.
