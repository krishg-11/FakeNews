Plan B? Kim Kardashian Says She’s Begging Her Little Sister Khloe To Carry Her Third Baby

Kim Kardashian recently revealed that she and hubby, Kanye West, would like to have more children so that daughter North and son Saint will grow up with lots of siblings.

However, the 36-year-old’s first two pregnancies caused significant damage to her uterus and now she’s unable to conceive naturally. Even after a risky surgery to repair the damage, doctors were unable to mend the problem, so now the celebrity couple must look into other options.

On Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, the reality star revealed that she’s been “begging” her younger sister Khloe to be her surrogate.

It’s a big ask for anyone, but considering that Khloe has no children of her own yet, we wonder how she’d feel about giving birth to her sister’s child.

If Khloe’s not willing, then it seems the siblings’ mum would be, with Kris Jenner telling Kim “I would do it in two seconds” in a recent episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians.

Whatever happens, Kim seems determined to have baby number three, so we’ve no doubt she’ll keep exploring her options.

In other news, the reality star recently celebrated her third wedding anniversary with Kanye. The couple kept things low-key, by taking their daughter North to Disneyland in Anaheim for the day.
