Joey Fatone Denies Rumors of *NSYNC Reunion at Super Bowl

Since it was announced that Justin Timberlake will be headlining the Pepsi Super Bowl LII Halftime Show, fans have held out hope that *NSYNC would use the occasion as a chance to reunite.

Standing outside of a bar this week, Fatone told TMZ that a reunion wouldn't be happening. "I'm here right now," he laughed. "If I was doing something, I'd be at rehearsals right now. So, obviously, there's your proof."

The former *NSYNC singer didn't appear upset about the fact that a reunion wasn't happening. He pointed out, "There's nothing wrong with that. Shit, he's doing his thing." *NSYNC's members most recently regrouped for a one-off performance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards.

TMZ's cameraperson also asked if Fatone thought Timberlake would bring Janet Jackson out during his performance as a nod to their controversial wardrobe malfunction incident at Super Bowl XXXVIII.

While Fatone couldn't confirm or deny a Jackson appearance, he did say, "He's not that kind of person. He's not controversial like that." Then, appearing to realize that Timberlake has had his share of controversial moments, Fatone added, "He is in a sense, but not in a sense to do it deliberately."

Timberlake is set to perform at the Super Bowl in Minneapolis, MN on February 4, 2018 as the Philadelphia Eagles take on the New England Patriots.
