Justin Bieber Was Asked If Hailey Baldwin Is Pregnant and He Got So Pissed

Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin recently got engaged after a month of dating (Summer 2018 strikes again!), and now the internet is speculating about WHY they're rushing into marriage.

The obvious answer is that Justin and Hailey are in love and want to spend forever together, but there's also a rumor lurking in some corners of the internet (read: Twitter) claiming that Hailey's pregnant. Which, to be clear, is definitely not anyone's business, and is also pretty sexist!

That aside, a pap caught up with Justin while he was buying coffee, and made the mistake of asking him about the rumors, saying "Is Hailey pregnant right now? You stated that you guys are family, so everybody was thinking she might be pregnant."

Justin's response? To stop in his tracks and call this dude out, saying "What’s your deal, bro? You just seem too like, you just seem too normal to be doing this job... I just don’t understand why you gotta try to get a rise, you know what I’m saying?" He also said "No, you know what you’re doing" when the pap tried to defend himself, and eventually asked for the camera to be turned off.

Honestly, Justin handled himself pretty well in the face of a highly inappropriate and boundary-crossing question. Agree?
