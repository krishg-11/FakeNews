STUNNING! Democrats BOO and GROAN at Trump Mention of Murder Victims of MS-13 Killers (VIDEO)

STUNNING! Democrats BOO and GROAN at Trump Mention of Murder Victims of MS-13 Killers (VIDEO)

President Trump invited Elizabeth Alvarado, Robert Mickens, Evelyn Rodriguez, and Freddy Cuevas to his State of the Union Address. They are the parents of Nisa Mickens and Kayla Cuevas, who had been close friends since elementary school, but in September 2016, the two girls were chased down and brutally murdered by MS-13.

On Tuesday night when the President honored the parents of Kayla and Nisa and the victims of illegal immigrant violence the Democrats groaned and booed.

This was a shocking display – even for today’s Democrats.

The #SOTU has exposed the Democrats for what they are. They just booed the parents of a murdered child & they sat on their butts for the portion of the speech about respecting the National Anthem. Unreal. — Dan Bongino (@dbongino) January 31, 2018

Awful.
