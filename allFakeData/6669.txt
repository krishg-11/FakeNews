“He thought he had the win in the bag, and wasn’t as visibly upset on-camera as he was off-camera,” an industry insider said.

“Hugh was so sure of his win, and had his acceptance speech ready.”

According to the source, the 49-year-old Wolverine star thought that after his recent string of blockbusters, “that there was really nothing to worry about.”

Sources said Jackman even had to take a breather after the shocking loss.

“Hugh was on fire afterwards, and was super upset at his management team. At one point, he got up out of his seat and didn’t return for a few minutes!”

As fans know, Franco, 39, nabbed the coveted award for his portrayal as filmmaker Tommy Wiseau, the director of 2003 flop The Room, which has been described by many critics as one of the worst movies ever made.
