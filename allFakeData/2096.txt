Celebrities React to Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos Not Knowing Anything About Education

If this is the intelligence private schools churn out, I think we're better off without them tbh



Also having watched this more, her smile is so fucking grating. I've never seen a more shit-eating grin.

Rich people don't send their kids to private school for education, they send them to keep their kids away from the poor kids. It's another form of segregation. Wouldn't want their kids to have some fucking empathy.



If rich kids had to go to school with poor kids you bet those schools would get funded in a heartbeat.

mte... i once heard this ~progressive~ super left guy once say that he wants to send his daughter to a private school so she'd network and socialize with the "right people". wtf.



aside from the snobbishness i don't get how people can justify the cost, like you can literally just send your kids to school for free lol, that money can go towards so much other stuff. Reply

They don't care about education in private schools either, tbh. Rich kids will get into good colleges no matter what.



It's just the Republican way to look at any social program/invaluable need and say, "Now how can we make this into a business so we can make even more fucking money?"



Small government= we want to run everything like a business. "Invest" in what makes them money, close up what doesn't, people's lives be damned. Reply

I went to a private school and I really hate to say it, but their holier than thou mentality is common. I've had classmates who think they are better educated just bc they went to our school and I hate it. I detest any of those claims saying that we're smarter and I lose so much respect for anyone who says anything similar. Reply

I hate Betsy Devos so much. It makes me feel ugly, the amount of hate I have for her.



This whole fucking charting school thing & her talking about individual investment. Is their idea of a functioning society one where they screen every student to decide who is worthy of investment?

You know it is. And the first thing they'll check is "White + American heritage goes back at least three generations." After that it's average income of their household. Reply

It's not even about investment in students, it's about who are your parents, are they wealthy WASPs? If not, you're not allowed, even if you're a freaking genius. Their criteria is much like that of Harvard and other ivy leagues, have a familial connection? Congratulations, if not, prepare to work your ass off and probably be denied on the basis that you "probably couldn't afford it". Reply

Omg. Queen Lesley not letting DeVos's incompetence slide and exposing her for the ignorant asshole she is!



The reason the Stormy Daniels thing is a big deal is because it could legitimately be a problem with campaign finance. I don't care about Trump fucking a porn star. That's not gonna get him impeached. But improperly using campaign funds or failing to disclose donations.... now that could be a big fucking deal.

I wouldn't hold your breath for anything Stormy might add to the conversation to be damning against Trump, there are piles of damning, way worse evidence against him and his entire family and nothing has been done about it. We can hope that Mueller is playing some sort of long ended chess game, but I'm ready for Trump and his entire cabinet out yesterday and I just have to accept that he'll finish his first term and then we'll have to deal with Ivanka running in another election cycle or two.



Betsy on the other hand, Congress APPROVED her, that's how horrific our entire system is. They KNEW she was unqualified but they didn't care, it suited their agenda and they're perfectly fine having someone who knows ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about education be the SECRETARY OF EDUCATION. Reply

I think about how ignorant and narrow-minded I was prior to moving away from Oklahoma and I just cringe. Literally cringe.



I feel like a lot of the people who wear their ignorance as a badge of honor are also ones who grew up poor and actually did fight their way to stability - not even wealth, just stability - by working their asses off at a time when working your way to the top was more possible than it is now. They did it without a college education so obviously college is just a scam and a waste, right?? And flat-out refuse to see that a) the world doesn't work that way anymore, b) education is vital now, and c) THEY ALSO GOT REALLY FRUCKING LUCKY Reply

My friend and I were talking about this last week. She thinks that as more and more people (POC, women, WOC, those from low income backgrounds) are getting educated, for some people, education is becoming less and less valued. I might take it a step further and suggest it's because they want to show they're better than the groups I just named. They've rebranded willful ignorance as not being manipulated by the media, speaking from the heart, whatever.



It's ridic but it wouldn't surprise me. Reply

I live in an area right now that's very..... poorly educated and proud of that. I've got about 15 months left here but between the proud ignorance, Fox News fucking everywhere, and lack of employment (especially for outsiders).... My depression its back at full force and I just don't know what to do. I've never lived in an area this stupid before. Reply

Idk who Adam H. Johnson is but from that one tweet alone, it seems I may have to start stanning him.



Also, DeVoss remains an idiot, what else is there to say? She’s a fucking entitled asshole who bought herself that position. When trump gets impeached, do we get to throw her out? Reply

I remember people stanning Joe Kennedy and then I saw this...

a+ on including the johnson tweet



all of the oprah stuff is just more boring "heal thyselves" pablum that pretends things like capitalism or inequality don't exist. if she actually wanted to help people, she'd advocate for socialism that would remove a lot of stress on poor people or even just some kind of harm-reduction program (ie, good educational institutions, free access to therapists) instead of some vague "love" that presupposes those kids' trauma as inevitable. but that'd go against her brand of useless self-help and threaten her and her friends' wealth



milwaukee in particular has a hard time budgeting for schools and is very racially segregated. talk about those and the failure of local governance (city and state) for decades to fix those issues, not the symptoms Reply

When I saw that Adam was included I was like hell yes.



Your comment is spot on as usual.



That self-help shit is played out. That school choice bullshit these con artist try to push is a way to segregate the students and steal public funds from already underfunded schools. Reply

Yeah, self-help can only go so far when your government is actively working to crush anyone who's not a wealthy white man (exception: a very few hand-picked women and POC, to make said government look inclusive and supportive)



DeVos is only a couple letters away from DeVil and that's fitting. Reply

This also reminds me that democrats have enabled a lot of this bullshit happening today. When people reminisce about the Clinton years I remember this clip...

Wealthy people are never gonna do things out of the kindness of their hearts. We shouldn't wait for them to end inequality. And democrats should stop helping the republicans make that inequality worse. We need real progressives in government to push real change.This also reminds me that democrats have enabled a lot of this bullshit happening today.
