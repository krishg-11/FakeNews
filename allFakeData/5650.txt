Brad Pitt Now Moonlighting in the Furniture Business

As Brad Pitt was not available for an interview about his new luxury furniture line with Frank Pollaro, the Times talked to a bunch of design experts for their thoughts instead. Their observations ranged from “swanky” to “stifled”; one critic noted, “I was surprised to discover that the bathtub was a bathtub; I thought it was an ashtray.” Here are our favorite gems (and yes, the Chanel No. 5 ad was referenced):

1. “The shiny metal surprised me specifically; the mod Trumpian swankiness, in general.”

2. “These pieces are too nice; I do not hear Mr. Pitt’s voice unleashed with full authority.”

3. “Mr. Pitt, you are a great actor. Stay that person, with all of his confidence and drive and risk-taking, when designing. These first pieces are audition monologues; you already have the part.”

4. “[A piece I would want in my home is] possibly the oval table — in the guest room of a second home, if I owned a second home.”

5. “I’m not convinced after seeing three table designs (and a bathtub that reminds me of an ashtray) that Brad Pitt should quit his day job to be in the furniture or product design game. Unless that means I can be an actor for a day and get paid $7 million to star in a Chanel No. 5 perfume ad.”
