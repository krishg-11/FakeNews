Beyonce & Jay-Z Hire 18 New Employees After Twins Sir and Rumi's Arrival Newborns now have six nannies, two maids and more!

Money’s no object when it comes to Beyonce and Jay-Z’s newborn twins!

RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal that the music power couple have added another 18 new people to the payroll now that their son Sir and daughter Rumi have joined their big sister Blue Ivy at home.

“This includes additional security, upgraded bullet-proof vehicles, six nannies, two maids, and a 24/7 rotating team of nurses,” an insider told Radar.

Rumi and Sir “even have a financial investment advisor working for them, setting up trademarks and trusts in the babies’ names,” continued the insider.

“They’ve also employed an expert to establish social media names and tags for the babies,” added the insider.

Surprisingly, adding almost two-dozen extra employees to Beyonce, 35, and 47-year-old Jay-Z’s already sizeable staff is absolutely no problem for the devoted parents, who just moved into a $25 million Malibu mansion.

“Bey and Jay’s entourage just got a hell of lot bigger, thanks to the twins, but they have the cash to do it.”
