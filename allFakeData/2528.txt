Is Lindsay Lohan opening a second club in Greece?

In a recent interview on the Wendy Williams Show, the Hollywood star, Lindsay Lohan spoke about many things, including her future business plans.

As it is known, the 31-year-old actress has opened the ”LOHAN” club in Athens in October 2016, which is very popular and successful as well. However, as she stated, she plans to open a second nightclub in Greece, and more particularly in Mykonos Island.

”I have my club in Athens and then we will open one in Mykonos. I thought, I’ve gone to many clubs, so I should have one of my own”, the actress stated.
