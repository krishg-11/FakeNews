David & Victoria Beckham Reportedly Living 'Separate Lives'

"They will always be family. But David and Victoria are leading very different lives," a source told Us Weekly about this possible celebrity tragedy . "It's not unusual for couples to change and grow apart," the insider continued about David "[doing] his own thing."

This couple has been married since 1999 and are reportedly living "separate lives."

And apparently, they even keep their distance at home with "his" and "her" wings across the house.

"I think they quite like having somewhat separate lives," the unnamed source alleged to Us.



David and Victoria Beckham have been married for 19 years and have four children together: son Brooklyn, 19, son Romeo, 15, son Cruz, 13, and daughter Harper, 6.
