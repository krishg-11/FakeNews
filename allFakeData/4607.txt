Debunking the week's tabloid stories: July 6, 2018

|

Angelina Jolie is calling off her divorce from Brad Pitt, according to a shocking story from Globe. The magazine reports she's ready to reunite with her estranged husband out of desperation.

In the wake of a judge warning Jolie she could lose physical custody of their kids if she doesn't facilitate a better relationship between the children and their father, the outlet explains the actress believes the only way to keep full custody of her kids is to get back together with Pitt and stop their divorce proceedings. "She's doing her best to mend her fractured relationship with Brad and become a family again," reveals an insider.

But while the publication describes Jolie as "blindsided" by the judge's ruling and in a panic over future access to her kids, the actress has been carrying on just fine. She recently went on a humanitarian trip to Iraq, has been filming Maleficent 2, and even took her children to Wicked on London's West End. Gossip Cop can also confirm she's made no effort towards reconciling with Pitt.

It should also be noted that this same tabloid falsely claimed Jolie and Pitt were getting back together in June. In that version of the narrative, their supposed reunion had nothing to do with avoiding custody issues, but was because they were allegedly still in love with each other. The truth then and now is that the divorce is still very much on.
