Us Weekly reported that Ben, 42, is dating 28-year-old Christine Ouzounian, who he and Garner hired back in the spring to be a nanny for their three children—Violet, 9, Seraphina, 6, and Samuel, 3.

The report said that the exes were on a secret 10-month trial separation when his romance with Christine first started. A friend of Ouzounian’s said that “they would hang out without the kids and they were very flirty.”
