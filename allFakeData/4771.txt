Margot Robbie In Talks For Hugh Hefner Playboy Biopic

One name that’s been thrown in the mix is Margot Robbie , who Hefner himself would have approved of, since Robbie was one star he couldn’t get to pose for his magazine. Back in 2014, after seeing Robbie’s performance in The Wolf of Wall Street, Hefner told Us Weekly , “She should be in Playboy! Send her a message. We’re ready for her. She would be great.”
