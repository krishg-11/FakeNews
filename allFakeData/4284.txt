Taylor Swift will reportedly keep her new album off streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music for a week

Taylor Swift will reportedly keep her upcoming album, "Reputation," off of streaming services during its first week of sales.

Swift kept her last album, "1989," off of Spotify for several years after removing her entire catalog from the service in late 2014.

"Reputation" will be available in retail outlets and online stores on November 10.

Representatives for Taylor Swift have told streaming services that the pop star's upcoming album, "Reputation," will be kept off streaming during its first week of sales, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg's Lucas Shaw.

Bloomberg's sources said that the streaming services are still negotiating with Swift to determine when "Reputation" will be available.

Swift has had a back-and-forth relationship with streaming services in recent years.

The singer kept her last album, "1989," off of Spotify upon its release in 2014, when she removed her entire back catalog from the service.

In July 2014, months prior to the album's release, Swift wrote an op-ed condemning Spotify's free tier in the Wall Street Journal, writing, "It's my opinion that music should not be free."

Swift allowed "1989" to stream on Apple Music, which does not offer a free tier, upon that service's launch in January 2015.

She eventually made her back catalog and "1989" available to stream on Spotify in June, after "1989" had sold over 10 million copies.

"Reputation" will be available for sale in retail outlets and online stores like the iTunes on November 10.
