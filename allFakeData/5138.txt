The world is raving about Tom Cruise in his latest action adventure, 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout'. I's being lauded as the best installment in the 'M:I' franchise, as one reviewer puts it 'one that kicks James Bond's ass'. However, he's not making news just on the work front, but also on the personal front. Buzz is that the actor is likely to reunite with his daughter Suri. The 12-year-old has reportedly written several letters to her father, asking him to reconnect with her.Cruise, 56, is keen to be an important part of his daughter's life. A source reportedly said that the actor has been allowed to see Suri for 10 days a month, but has refrained from doing so since his divorce from Katie Holmes in 2012. Many attribute it to his association with the Scientology - the members are not allowed to keep in touch with people who don't follow their way of life and in Cruise's case, it was Katie who was no longer a part of the system. However, things may just change. Reports state Suri's heartbreaking voicemails to him seems to be breaking his resolve. A source has revealed to a magazine that the actor has reached out to his daughter through a third party and let her know that he's thought of her all the time and read and listened to all her messages.There was much speculation about Suri looking upset during her trip in Paris with her mother. It is believed that she may have been thinking about her father or missing his presence.While Cruise is reportedly single since the divorce, Katie is rumoured to be dating actor Jamie Foxx.
