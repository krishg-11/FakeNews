Why Kylie Jenner Actually Removed All Her Lip Fillers

Kylie Jenner, who made an almost billion-dollar empire off of marketing her giant lips, recently revealed on Instagram that she had stopped getting lip filler injections. She didn't say why, but Entertainment Tonight solved that mystery with the help of a source: it was part learning to love her natural look (and having to stop them anyway because she was pregnant), part becoming a mother.

"During Kylie's pregnancy, she wasn't getting her usual fillers or putting on much makeup," the source explained. "Kylie really fell in love with the natural look, and wanted more of that, so she decided to stop putting filler in her lips."



Stormi also led to the change, the source continued: “Despite the fact that Kylie is a master of branding and has made an almost billion-dollar business off her lips and cosmetics, once Stormi was born, Kylie realized she was a mother first, and that is a big reason she has been sporting the more natural look. Kylie is a master of branding, and she plays with the concept of mother—the more natural look—and her Kylie Cosmetics look, full glam."

The filler likely isn't all gone now though, New York City plastic surgeon and RealSelf contributor Dr. David Shafer told the outlet, as the injections last 6-12 months. "She likely has some residual filler, which will slowly metabolize naturally," Shafer said. So we're not quite at the full 'after' look yet.
