Celebrities React to President Trump's Incendiary Press Conference

On Thursday, President Donald Trump held an unscheduled press conference. The purpose, it seemed, was to announce his new pick for labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, one day after Andrew Puzder withdrew his nomination for the position.

But after a minute or so of talking about Acosta, Trump launched into a nearly hour-and-a-half long rant in which he harshly criticized at the media, told a series of blatantly incorrect "facts" about how popular he was, and went off on Hillary Clinton.

Celebrities had a lot of feelings about this one:

Kendrick Sampson

The press conferences keep getting more bizarre. I honestly wonder if this man is mentally stable. And he's still going on about Hillary! pic.twitter.com/1c4CvnBnW3 ‚Äî Kendrick Sampson (@kendrick38) February 16, 2017

Trump just shut down a Jewish man asking abt the rise in anti-Semitic attacks in the U.S. saying "I am the least racist/anti-Semitic person" ‚Äî Kendrick Sampson (@kendrick38) February 16, 2017
