Rita’s sexy Fifty Shades Freed duet with the 1D star, For You, is on course to become the biggest new entry on the official charts this week.

But producers of the upcoming movie sequel had different plans for the first single and wanted Justin Bieber to be the man to get listeners hot under the collar.

A source told me: “Originally Universal Pictures wanted Justin Bieber to sing a song on the soundtrack, either with or without Rita.

“He’s the biggest male pop star in the world and so that’s what they aimed for.

“They had the world’s biggest female pop star in Taylor Swift do the last film, so they were keen for something a bit different because Zayn Malik sang that with her and he comes from One Direction as well.”

However, after a turbulent 14-month concert tour Justin is intent on having a break and made it clear he would not be taking on any extra recording commitments.

Fortunately Liam was on hand and got involved thanks to Rita, who had the tune prepped with songwriter pals Ali Payami, Ali Tamposi and Andrew Watt.

And he couldn’t be happier to have another hit under his belt.

He gushed: “Me and Rita are absolutely overjoyed with the reaction so far to For You. We are super happy.”

Reets celebrated the early success with a Fifty Shades inspired snap.
