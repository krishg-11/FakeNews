Debunking the week's tabloid stories: July 20, 2018

|

Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt got "married" again, announces In Touch on the cover of its latest issue. The magazine reveals they tied the knot "on their 18th wedding anniversary."

The outlet leaks that the former couple "quietly rekindled their relationship earlier this year," and have now "pledged their commitment to each other all over again.‚Äù A friend of the stars reveals, "They were recently 'married' in a commitment ceremony."

Aniston and Pitt are still legally married to other people, but they were "so eager to wed again," it's said they had a "private, unofficial ceremony in the backyard of his house in the Pacific Palisades." The publication reports Courteney Cox and George Clooney served as the maid of honor and best man, respectively, and that all of Pitt's kids were in attendance.

These claims, however, are all provably false. Pitt's children have been in London since May and aren't due to return to L.A. until this weekend. Aniston, meanwhile, has been filming a movie in Montreal since June, while Clooney has been working in Sardinia and Rome. Also, Aniston and Pitt's original wedding anniversary isn't until July 29.

Most importantly, as Gossip Cop has repeatedly reported, the exes have not gotten back together. Pitt's spokesperson tells us this wedding narrative is "false" and "totally ridiculous," while Aniston's own rep adds that it was simply "made-up."
