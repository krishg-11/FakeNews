"History has its share of incredible untold stories, and this is one of the most compelling, the tale of three African-American women - engineers, physicists, mathematicians - who in their work for NASA in the early 1960s were integral in calculating the flight trajectories for Project Mercury and Apollo 11," said Festival Chairman Harold Maztner. "Fueled by the performances of Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Mon√°e, the ensemble cast also features outstanding performances from Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, Jim Parsons, Mahershala Ali, Glen Powell and many others. The Palm Springs International Film Festival is proud to present the entire cast of Hidden Figures with the 2017 Ensemble Performance Award."
