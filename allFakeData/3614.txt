Kanye West Wants Wife Kim Kardashian’s Support As He Continues Twitter Meltdown.

Krazy Kanye Desperate For Kim’s Support As He Tweets Off The Deep End Kardashian is trying to distance herself from her hubby & his puzzling rants.

As he continues his social media ramblings, RadarOnline.com has learned exclusively Kanye West is desperate for wife Kim Kardashian to show more support, and wants the world to see them as a united couple.

“It really bothers Kanye that Kim’s distancing herself from him lately, and he knows people are gossiping about trouble in the marriage,” a source told Radar.

As Radar readers know, West, 40, has been on a tweeting tirade for the past several weeks, and even admitted to undergoing liposuction and abusing painkillers.

But after the rapper said during a live TV interview that “slavery was a choice,” his family started getting threats from people close to dangerous gangs.

“Kim defended him on Twitter at first,” the source confided. “But the reality is that she’d rather stay as far away from his drama as possible and has made it very clear that she’s not going to keep rushing to his aid.”

That lack of support has only fueled West’s rage, and Kardashian and mom Kris Jenner are worried they’ll have to step in and stop him. But the source says West knows what he is doing and is just looking for a little loyalty from his life partner.

“In his mind, they could be the most powerful couple and spread an important message together, but Kim’s not interested in getting caught up in this,” the source concluded. “At this point she’ll do whatever she can to avoid drawing attention to Kanye’s embarrassing rants.”
