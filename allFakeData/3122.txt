Tom Cruise and Jane Fonda spark romance rumours

The famous pair shared the stage as they introduced previews for Cruise’s upcoming film Mission: Impossible – Fallout and Fonda’s Book Club – their flirty banter not going unnoticed by the audience.

According to onlookers, their flirting was evident to everyone and they couldn’t keep their hands off each other.

‘Tom was hanging on Jane’s every word, and she was touching his arm repeatedly and having a lot of fun – it was clear that they were really enjoying one another’s company. In fact, some were even wondering if there was more to their obvious connection and whether their chemistry would eventuate into something more. The flirting was off the scale.’

Jane, 80, who is famous for looking younger than her years and separating from her longtime boyfriend Richard Perry last year, is in the middle of a career renaissance and shows no sign of slowing down.

Tom, 55, has also enjoyed renewed success with a string of hit action films, and was last rumoured to be dating his Fallout co-star Vanessa Kirby.

‘Tom and Jane were certainly very taken with each other and everyone was talking about it,’ an insider tells New Idea.

‘They spent a couple of hours together, laughing and talking – it was really like there was no-one else at the party.

‘Sure, Jane is a little older than Tom – but he’s had older girlfriends before and this is the first woman in a really long time who’s managed to captivate him.

‘Tom was left feeling a little shell-shocked after his split from Katie, but he really wants to put himself back out there and find love again,’ the source added.
