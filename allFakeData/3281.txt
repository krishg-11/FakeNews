Ben Affleck & Jennifer Garner File For Divorce Amid Reconciliation Rumors

It took them two years, a superhero franchise and a countless trips to the Brentwood farmer’s market, but Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck have officially filed for divorce.

The couple apparently coordinated their filing sans lawyers, according to TMZ, which was first to break the news, with Garner sending her court papers in Thursday and Affleck responding shortly after.

The two are seeking joint legal and physical custody of their children, Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, 4, so it looks like they’re avoiding a Brangelina-style situation entirely.

The decision to officially divorce comes amid speculation that the former Hollywood golden twosome were reconciling, as the two have continued to act very much like a couple (going on vacations together, praising each other in the press and co-parenting their children) since announcing their split in June 2015.

But according to sources per People magazine, Garner and Affleck have taken their sweet time to iron out the details, like division of property and assets, as well as spousal support, since they do not have a prenuptial agreement.

The two reportedly remain “super amicable” and have done everything with their children in mind.

“They always planned to divorce despite what people said. If you look at their first statement it says divorce, not separate,” a source told the magazine. “They just did it the way they wanted to and did what was best for their kids. There was no catalyst, it was just time. Nothing has changed, they are and still will be putting their kids first.”

The divorce could be made final within the year, so until then let’s raise a toast to Bennifer 2.0 and their love story. It’s the end of an era.
