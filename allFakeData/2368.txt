Gigi Hadid pulls out of Victoria's Secret Fashion Show following 'racist' Buddha Instagram video

Gigi Hadid has revealed she will no longer be walking in the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show 2017 in Shanghai.

It comes just a few months after she was accused of “mocking Asians” in a “racist” Instagram video.

The 22-year-old model, who was scheduled to walk the runway with her sister Bella Hadid, posted on Twitter on Thursday to say that she would not be travelling to China to do the show.

She wrote: “'I’m so bummed I won’t be able to make it to China this year,' she wrote. Love my VS family, and will be with all my girls in spirit!! Can't wait to tune in with everyone to see the beautiful show I know it will be, and already can't wait for next year!”

Hadid, who is dating former One Direction star Zayn Malik, was warned not to take part in the show after she was filmed squinting her eyes as she held up a Buddha cookie and appeared to impersonate the face. The video was posted online by her sister.

In September, critics warned Hadid not to attend this year’s show beneath her Instagram post announcing that she had been selected to take part again.

One person commented: “We like some people who respects us, not you. What you have done made us unhappy. And Chinese do not welcome you. So don’t come to China (sic).”

Another posted: “As a Chinese, we don't welcome racist to China.”

A third claimed they had reported her to the Chinese authorities, writing: “I have reported to the Chinese government, and I hope you can not come to China.”

Hadid has not revealed the reason why she is not taking part in the show.

It was reported on Tuesday that four models had experienced difficulties in getting their Chinese visas approved.
