Michael Strahan 'Looking Forward' To Working With Alex Rodriguez At ABC

Alex Rodriguez is joining ABC, and Gossip Cop hears no one could be happier or “looking forward more” than fellow athlete Michael Strahan. As it was recently reported, Rodriguez has signed on to be an ABC News contributor, and is set appear from time-to-time on “Good Morning America,” “Nightline,” and “World News Tonight.” The former Yankees star will do segments and comment on finance, fitness and family-related stories. An accomplished entrepreneur, Rodriguez is also slated to appear next season on ABC’s “Shark Tank.”

And welcoming the baseball legend to the network, we’re told, is Strahan, who similarly transitioned from sports to talk show host (with Kelly Ripa) to now a news anchor. A mutual friend of ours and Strahan leaks to Gossip Cop, “Michael is looking forward to having Alex as part of the ‘GMA’ team. In fact, they have several other projects they are doing together.” In addition to working together at ABC, Strahan is producing a show on CNBC called “Back In The Game,” and Rodriguez is the series’ host. Basically, Rodriguez will help an athlete who’s fallen on hard financial times get back on his feet or create a business.
