Charlize Theron & Seth McFarlane had a sushi date last night: cute or terrible?

First of all, Charlize Theron’s hair has grown out to the point where she and Ellen DeGeneres could be twinsies, right? This is Ellen’s hair completely. Secondly (and more importantly), these are photos of Charlize out to dinner at Matsuhisa with her new boyfriend, Seth McFarlane. Did I jump the gun by calling Seth her boyfriend? Eh. According to sources, Seth and Charlize met in January for business-related stuff (she signed on to his planned western/spoof A Million Ways To Die In the West), then spent some social time together late in the awards season, partied together after the Oscars and now it looks like the rumors were true – they are together!

These were taken last night in West Hollywood, and Seth and Charlize came out of a sushi place. Note how Charlize is hiding her face in some of these pics? Do you think that’s just her natural reticence or is she actually shame-dating Seth and she doesn’t want people to know? My general thought on Charlize is that she would never shame-date someone. If Charlize is going to take the trouble to bang you, she doesn’t mind if people know. More likely she’s hiding her face because she just didn’t want to be photographed at that moment or whatever. And whatever she has going with Seth is barely a month old, so it is a little early to be so public, you know? You can see more photos of Seth and Charlize here.
