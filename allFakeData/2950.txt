'Game of Thrones' Co-Stars Kit Harington and Rose Leslie Are Engaged

Wedding bells are coming.

Looks like Ygritte and Jon Snow were meant to be, after all.

Game of Thrones co-stars Rose Leslie and Kit Harington are engaged. The news was confirmed with an engagement announcement placed in The Times of London on Wednesday.

The announcement reads: "The engagement is announced between Kit, younger son of David and Deborah Harington of Worcestershire, and Rose, middle daughter of Sebastian and Candy Leslie of Aberdeenshire."

The couple first sparked rumors about their offscreen romance in 2012 when they were spotted having a dinner date in London. Leslie, 30, and Harington, 30, reportedly split a year later, before getting back together in 2014.

The duo didn't make their first public appearance together as a couple until the Olivier Awards in London in 2016. Harington opened up about falling in love with Leslie during an interview with L'Uomo Vogue, saying, "If you’re already attracted to someone, and then they play your love interest in the show, it becomes very easy to fall in love."

In June, Harington revealed that he had moved in with Leslie during his appearance on CBS' The Late Late Show With James Corden.

"I've moved in with my other best friend, Rose," said Harington. “So, I’m very. very happy and it’s going well. She has all sorts of ideas for the house. I said to her, because she moved into my house, 'Look, darling, this is important that it's our space, that it feels like our space and that you haven't just moved into mine. Move anything you want around — change anything or chuck anything out.' "

Congrats to the couple!
