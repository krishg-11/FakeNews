Two years ago Kim Kardashian attempted to bring down Taylor Swift when she tweeted ‘Wait it’s legit National Snake Day?!?!?They have holidays for everybody, I mean everything these days!’

Now the stuff of legend, the tweet led to Kimye fans bombarding Taylor’s social media accounts with the snake emoji and the pop star ended up going radio silent for nearly a year as she worked on her epic comeback album Reputation.

But Taylor has never been one to take anything lying down, and now fans believe she may have just thrown the most subtlest of epic shade as she has been pictured two years on wearing a snake-print backpack.

Tay has embraced the snake symbolism, coming back to social media after deleting years worth of content with three videos of snakes, using snake imagery on her tour merchandise and even riding a giant snake basket on the tour.

‘Excuse me while I scream about the fact that Taylor Swift is out in the open carrying a bag with a snakeskin print on the 2 year anniversary of the day Kimberly Kardashian called her a snake on social media and the internet sent her into hiding with #TaylorSwiftIsOverParty,’ tweeted one fan.

‘taylor swift stepping out of her apartment wearing a snake backpack and the same print she wore in a segment of the lwymmd music video on national snake day and the anniversary of kim kardashian’s shady tweet about her is the biggest power move i’ve ever seen (sic),’ said a second.
