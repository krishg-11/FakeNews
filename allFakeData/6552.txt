Why Does Kim Cattrall Hate Sarah Jessica Parker? A Timeline of the Sex and the City Feud

October 2017

During an interview with Piers Morgan, Cattrall says she will not do another Sex and the City movie and that she was never really friends with her Sex and the City co-stars.

When asked by Morgan if there will ever be more Sex and the City, Cattral said, “Not for me. That was part of turning 60. That was a very clear moment of how many years do I have left and what do I want to do with it? What haven’t I done? I feel that the show was the best when it was the series and the bonus was the two movies.”
