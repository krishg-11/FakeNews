Morgan Freeman Narrates One of Hillary Clinton’s Closing Campaign Ads

Hillary Clinton’s campaign is debuting some of her closing arguments in her campaign ads, including a spot that is narrated by Morgan Freeman.

Titled “Example,” the spot contrasts Clinton’s career with that of Donald Trump, positioning it as a choice of “who will we entrust our country and their future to.” For example, the ad presents Clinton as knowledgable and steady, and Trump as unprepared and reckless.

The one-minute ad, below, will air as part of an existing ad buy in Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as on with national cable.

Clinton’s campaign has also featured ads from the Shonda Rhimes produced shows “Scandal,” “How to Get Away With Murder” and “Grey’s Anatomy,” as well as one featuring the cast of “Empire.”

Freeman narrated an ad for Clinton that aired before the South Carolina primary, and also was the voice heard on a biographical video shown at the Democratic National Convention. He also narrated an ad for President Obama’s reelection campaign in 2012.
