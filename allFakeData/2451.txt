The unusual tool Selena Gomez uses for glowing skin

Good news: You can now achieve your glow goals without the need for a luxe spa treatment (or reaching for your highlighter!).

It’s all thanks to a nifty little skin care tool that’s been approved by none other than Selena Gomez herself. It’s called the Rose Quartz Heart Facial Sculptor and it’s part of Miranda Kerr’s skin care brand, Kora Organics.

Celebrity makeup artist Hung Vanngo recently took to Instagram Stories to share a clip of himself using the clever beauty tool to massage Selena’s skin – and we’re pretty sure we need this in our life, now.

Check out Vanngo and Selena showing us how it’s done:
