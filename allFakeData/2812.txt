Brad Pitt and Princess Charlotte baby news

Sources tell New Idea that he and new girlfriend Charlotte Casiraghi – the daughter of Princess Caroline and ninth in line to the throne of Monaco – are desperately trying for a baby, as their relationship goes from strength to strength.

The pair fell in love in September, before debuting their romance at a Hollywood event in LA last month. Even though Brad has been careful not to be photographed with his new love while his divorce settlement is still before the courts, sources tell New Idea that he’s ‘totally head over heels’ for new love Charlotte – so much so, they’re now planning a royal baby.
