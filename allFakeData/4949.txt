Kourtney Kardashian Going Under The Knife To Transform Voice!

Kourtney Kardashian Going Under The Knife To Transform Voice! ‘She hates hearing how nasal she sounds on TV,’ a pal reveals.

Kourtney Kardashian’s getting vocal about how much she dislikes her voice —

And pals said she’s looking into surgery to give herself a more refined sound!

A pal close to the reality star confided that Kourtney, 38, has been researching doctors who perform laryngoplasty, a procedure that transforms the voice box.

“Kourt knows she has the most annoying voice out of all of her sisters,” a buddy exposed. “She hates watching her scenes and hearing how nasal she sounds.”

The mother of three admires women with strong voices, like Ashley Judd and Emma Stone, and believes going under the knife will help her achieve a similar result, added the snitch.

“She hopes surgery will give her voice a makeover. She sees it as no different from a boob job or any of the other cosmetic makeovers she’s had in the past,” the source said.

“Her mother, Kris, suggested she get voice lessons — but Kourt told her to butt out!”
