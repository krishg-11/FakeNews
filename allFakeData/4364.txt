Rumor Bust! Prince Harry & Meghan Markle Not Moving to Malibu

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are not moving to Malibu, despite a report.

Gossip Cop already busted a report that Harry and Meghan bought a beach house in the L.A. suburb ahead of their May 19 wedding. Now GC is shutting down another story that claims the royals have their eyes on a $16-million holiday pad.

A royal insider says the couple’s home base will remain Kensington Palace, and Gossip Cop points out that Markle won’t be able to take any extended time away from England as she applies for British citizenship.
