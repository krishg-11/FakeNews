Rosie Huntington-Whiteley Shares Rare Image Of Baby Jack

Despite her (and fiancé Jason Statham's) astronomical success and fame, Rosie Huntington-Whitely has managed to keep her private life largely just that: private.

And this privacy most keenly, and understandably, applies to their almost two-year-old son Jack who is largely absent from Huntington-Whitely's Instagram page.

The former ELLE UK cover star has kept her son's face hidden or largely obscured on the photo-sharing app since his birth in 2017 - until now.

In our biggest glimpse of little Jack yet, the Rose Inc founder posted a carousel of black and white snaps of the pair for a Pipette Baby advert.

The toddler can be seen grinning at his model (figuratively and literally) mother wearing a nappy whilst sitting in a very professional-looking leather chair - probably already preparing to take over his mother's beauty business when he turns 18.

'It sounds so clichéd, but it’s just been the most magical experience.' The former Victoria's Secret angel told Harper's Bazaar of her move into motherhood, 'Everything feels so special and sweet and wholesome and loving and then at the same time it's been... life-changing, and my focus is now this person; this is what I want to do.

'This is what I want to pour my heart into now.'

Well that may well be the most adorable thing we hear today.
