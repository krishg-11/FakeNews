Sofia Richie

21st-century American model

Sofia Richie (born August 24, 1998)[1] is an American model and fashion designer.[2] She has been featured in campaigns by a number of major brands including Tommy Hilfiger, Michael Kors and Chanel. She is the younger daughter of singer and songwriter Lionel Richie and sister to fashion designer and television personality Nicole Richie.

Early life [ edit ]

Sofia Richie was born in Los Angeles, California to parents Lionel Richie and his second wife Diane Alexander. She is the younger sister of Nicole Richie (who was adopted) and the biological sister of Miles Richie.[1] Sofia Richie's godfather was Michael Jackson. She reported that the visits to Jackson's Neverland Ranch were some of her favorite memories as a child, and she became close friends with his daughter, Paris.[3]

Richie grew up with an affinity for music like her father. She learned to sing at age five and play the piano at age seven.[4] She made occasional appearances at her father's shows[3] and took vocal lessons from vocal coach, Tim Carter, when she was 14, as well.[4] She also worked in the studio with her brother-in-law (and Good Charlotte lead vocalist) Joel Madden.[5][4] She decided to move away from a music career, however, because of the pressure of living up to her father's stature in the music industry.[6]

Richie spent some time at Oaks Christian School—nicknamed "Celebrity High"—before being educated at home for several years while her father was on tour. She played soccer until age 16 when she broke her hip in a Segway accident.[6]
