Twitter community mourns with Lea Michele

Twitter is mourning with Lea Michele in the wake of the apparent overdose of her boyfriend and “Glee” co-star Cory Monteith on Saturday.

Monteith, 31, was found dead in his Vancouver, British Columbia, hotel room, according to police, who said an autopsy is expected Monday to determine the cause of death.

Police said Monteith had been out with people earlier, but video and electronic records from the hotel indicated he returned to his room by himself early Saturday morning. He was believed to be alone when he died.

Lea Michele, Monteith’s real-life girlfriend who was in Mexico when the news reached her, has pleaded for privacy, but fans from all over the world are tweeting at #LeaMichele, #PrayForLea, #StayStrongLea, #StayStrongLeaMichele, where millions are sending thoughts, prayers and posting pictures of the petite half-Jewish singer/actress with Monteith.

Buzz Feed, which projects “the viral web in realtime,” has put together a timeline of their relationship, which is also being massively retweeted, alongside memes (images reflecting a cultural trend or idea) such as:

“ALL FANDOMS RT AND PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD. DO IT FOR CORY, LEA AND THE GLEEKS. #RipCoryMonteith #PrayForLea http://t.co/QppzEBHZUY” — cat; 77 days til ni (@simplyhoran) July 15, 2013

Some fans simply write to the star, saying nothing, just sending their Twitter thoughts.
