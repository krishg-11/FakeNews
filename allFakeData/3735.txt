My personal casting choices for the live action The Little Mermaid:

Prince Eric: Ezra Miller, Timothée Chalamet, or Elliot Fletcher

Grimsby: Ian McKellen or Liam Neeson

King Triton: Dwayne Johnson or Jason Momoa

Ursula: Harvey Fierstein (who I think will actually be playing her !!)

Vanessa: Vanessa Hudgens, Camila Mendes, or Selena Gomez

Sebastian: Shaggy, Sean Paul, or Kevin Michael Richardson (or his original voice Samuel E. Wright)

Ariel’s sisters: Chloe Bailey (obviously), Zendaya, Coco Jones, Lauryn McClain, Sierra Aylina McClain, and China Anne McClain
