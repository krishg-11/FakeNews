Back Together? Jennifer Garner & Ben Affleck Caught Getting Super Flirty During Church Visit

Jennifer and Ben attended church together on Sunday with their kids, Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6.

The couple, who divorced in 2015, were caught getting super flirty during the religious service.

At one point, Ben even got so close to the actress their heads were touching!

As OK! readers know, since their split Ben has moved on with Saturday Night Live director, Lindsay Shookus.

But that hasn't stopped Jen from wanting to fix things with her ex. “She put her heart and soul into fixing the relationship and wanted so desperately to turn things around for the children’s sake as well as theirs. She forgave him for so much, and still he couldn’t change," a source explained to Us Weekly.

The mom-of-three dressed casually for the outing, in a white sweater and black dress pants while her ex wore jeans, a red t-shirt and a blue letterman jacket.
