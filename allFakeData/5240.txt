AceShowbiz - It seems that Kate Middleton is now having trust issues with Prince William following his recent flirty ski trip to Switzerland. The Duchess of Cambridge is said forbidding him from solo travel as she's allegedly furious after seeing all pictures and videos that emerged from the ski trip.

National Enquirer is the first to claim that Kate refuses to let William travel alone, blaring an alarming headline, "Kate Puts Wild William On A Short Leash." The publication goes on citing a so-called source as saying, "Kate was furious when she saw the pictures. These boys-only skiing trips are a thing of the past."

"Kate wears the trousers in their marriage," the alleged insider further purports, before adding that the mother of 3-year-old George and 1-year-old Charlotte found her husband's behavior "humiliating and William will be made to pay."

No Kensington Palace reps have responded to the news. As reported before, Prince William skipped a Commonwealth Day service to enjoy a lads-only holiday. He was partying with his pals Guy Pelly, James Meade and Tom van Straubenzee at a club in Verbier, Switzerland on Monday, March 13.

The second in line to the throne in England was rumored cheating on his wife Kate after he was spotted "having a cozy lunch" with Aussie-born model %cSophie Taylor% during the ski trip. The two were reportedly drinking beer, wine and Jagerbombs at the Verbier resort. They were also pictured high-fiving.
