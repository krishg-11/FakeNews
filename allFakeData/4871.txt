Kristen Stewart's Gay Rumor; Tila Tequila's Suicide Stunt

Is Kristen Stewart gay?

Australian model, MTV VJ and fashion designer Ruby Rose wrote on Twitter: "I'm sorry, but Kristen Stewart has to be a lesbian. I don't mean to stereotype but isn't it obvious?'' Huh? Is it because she prefers Chucks and combat boots to frills and heels? Hmm. The weirdest thing about this is that something random Ruby Rose Tweeted as a "joke" became "news" on a "news" site. But you know what? That pic of KStew and RPatz that has been floating around the internets is positively post-coital. [News.com.au]
