Kim Kardashian Doesn't Sound Like She Ever Liked Tristan Thompson

Kim Kardashian sat down for an extensive interview with Ellen DeGeneres on Monday, April 30.

Among the many topics discussed between host and ex-sex tape star, of course, was the dishonesty and infidelity of Tristan Thompson.

As previously cited, Kardashian said simply that Thompson cheating on sister Khloe Kardashian was just so "f-cked up," a term she apologized for using on air.

But an appropriate term nonetheless, right?

Elsewhere in this sit-down, Kim described the entire situation as "sad," while not exactly answering Ellen directly when asked if she EVER liked Thompson.

Instead, she rambled on about how Khloe often "dives in" to romances and the family supports her as best they can.

Interesting, right?

As for other subjects touched on in this semi-revealing Q&A?

Kim wanted to initially name her third child Jo or Grace.

Kanye played the game Connect 4 during Chicago's delivery. (In his defense, Kim was not the one doing the delivering; they used a surrogate.)

"The second she came out, any fear that I had of, 'Will I not have this connection? Will she not look like me?' all of that goes out the door, and instantly, she's ours," Kim of watching a surrogate birth Chicago.

"It's such a good feeling."

Saint has an "amazing vocabulary" and may be a genius.

North has been "better" with Chicago than she was with Saint when he was first born but that Saint is still the "nicer" one."

Yes, despite photo evidence to the contrary at times, Kanye West is a happy person.

As for Kim's extended feelings on Thompson, both now and even before this scandal hit?
