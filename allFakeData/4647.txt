Hailey Baldwin Begs Justin Bieber To Propose

Make Me Your Wife! Hailey Baldwin Begs Justin Bieber To Propose She hopes he's ready to 'take the next step,' says source.

Make me your wife!

Hailey Baldwin is thrilled to be back with Justin Bieber, and sources tell RadarOnline.com she’s already hoping to make it official with a proposal!

“Hailey has always been crazy about Justin,” revealed the insider. “They stayed friends after ending their romance but it’s no secret that she was hoping it would turn into something more again.”

As readers know, Bieber’s broken heart over losing Selena Gomez didn’t last long, since the 24-year-old ladies’ man got back ex Baldwin just month after his breakup with the Latina heartthrob.

But Baldwin was indifferent about Bieber’s rapid change of heart from Gomez and wanted to move things along with him anyways. “She’s finally got what she wanted and now that they’re together, she’s wants to make things official as soon as possible.”

“They already know each other so well and have a great connection, so Hailey wants this to move fast.”

Alec Baldwin‘s daughter was eager to make her romance with the “Baby” singer official and was “begging” him to propose. “She would love to marry Justin and hopes that he’s ready to take that step with her.”

The celebrity spawn wasn’t hiding her desires to tie the know with The Biebs. “Hailey is dropping plenty of hints that she’s eager to settle down but she’s also being careful not to push him away.”

“The last thing she wants is to lose him again.”
