Michelle Obama is Naked, Topless on the Cover of a Spanish Lifestyle Magazine

A Spanish publication, Magazine de Fuera de Serie, released an explosive cover of Michelle Obama's head superimposed on the body of a slave.

Michelle face tops the body of an African Guadeloupean female slave painted by French artist Marie-Guilhelmine Benoist in 1800, which critics say is a racist interpretation of the modern day politico.

The first lady is draped in an American flag, wears a headscrarf with her breast out, and is perched beside the the headline — "Michelle Granddaughter of a Slave, Lady of America."

No word on the article accompanying the art, but we do know the picture is one in a series by artist Karine Percheron-Daniels of famous people's heads — Princess Diana, Queen Elizabeth II, Abraham Lincoln, and President Barack Obama — atop nude or partially nude art subjects.

Meanwhile, Karine says she's sure Michelle would "love" the picture and she hopes the president's wife sees it one day.

What are your thoughts? Racist or artistically OK?
