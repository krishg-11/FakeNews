What are the Pentagon Papers

“The Post” takes place in 1971 and chronicles how The Washington Post defied the Nixon administration to publish stories based on the Pentagon Papers, a secret government study about the Vietnam War.

The newspaper — along with the New York Times, which published Pentagon Papers stories and excerpts first — faces off against a Justice Department that believes publishing the information is a national security risk, a battle that ends up in the Supreme Court.

Meryl Streep plays Katharine Graham, the publisher of The Post, whose advisors tell her not to greenlight the stories, as the resulting legal troubles could threaten the paper’s existence. Tom Hanks plays Ben Bradlee, The Post’s executive editor, who believes the information should be printed — for the sake of the public and The Post’s reputation.
