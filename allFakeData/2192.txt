Lena Dunham and Jack Antonoff have split up

Lena Dunham and Jack Antonoff have confirmed that they have split up.

The Girls actor and writer and the Bleachers singer/songwriter had been a couple since 2012, but it has now been revealed that they separated last month.

“It was mutual,” a source told E! News. “Jack and Lena were growing apart and it just made sense for them to end their relationship where it was.”

They added: “They want the best for each other no matter what. They are both moving on.”

Representatives from the couple then confirmed that they were no longer together.

Bleachers, whose recent album ‘Gone Now‘ was named as one of NME’s best albums of 2017, last year had Dunham direct the video for ‘Don’t Take The Money‘.

Recent years have seen Antonoff act as producer and co-writer with the likes of St Vincent, Lorde and Taylor Swift – the latter once said that his relationship with Dunham inspired the ‘1989’ album track ‘You Are In Love‘.

“I’ve never had that, so I wrote that song about things that Lena [Dunham] has told me about her and Jack [Antonoff],” she said. “That’s just basically stuff she’s told me. And I think that that kind of relationship — God, it sounds like it would just be so beautiful — would also be hard. It would also be mundane at times.”
