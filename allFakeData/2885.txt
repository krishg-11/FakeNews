Taylor Swift's Reputation becomes first album to surpass two million in sales since 2015

Taylor Swift's Reputation has just surpassed two million sales, making it the first album to do so since Adele's 25 in 2015.

Currently in its 18th week of release, it's also only one of two albums from last year to sell more than one million copies, Ed Sheeran's ÷ being the other, according to Nielsen tracking figures. Reputation hit the milestone in its first week of release, selling 1.2 million copies.

All of Swift's six previous studio albums - 1989, Red, Speak Now, Fearless, and Taylor Swift - sold more than two million copies.

However, Forbes pointed out that, interestingly, it took significantly longer for Reputation to hit that phenomenal milestone. In fact, longer than Swift's past three albums combined.

2014's 1989 hit 2 million during its third week of release, 2012's Red during its fifth week of release, and 2010's Speak Now during its sixth week. Even 2008's Fearless took only seven weeks to pass 2 million sales.

Swift’s 50-plus-stop stadium tour will commence on 8 May. She recently released the video for her new single "Delicate", which imagined the musician gaining the power of invisibility, allowing her a brief sojourn away from her much-tormenting "reputation".
