Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber Are "Talking Babies" (EXCLUSIVE)





There wasn’t just romance in the air when Justin Bieber‘s dad, Jeremy, said “I do” to Chelsey Rebelo in Jamaica on Feb. 19. With Chelsey expecting a baby girl this summer, there was also baby fever going around — particularly for groomsman Justin, 24, and his girlfriend Selena Gomez, 25.

“Justin and Selena are talking babies now!” a source exclusively tells Life & Style. “They spent a lot of their time at the wedding playing with all the kids, and they both think it’s the perfect time to take their relationship to the next level.”

Those children they played with included Chelsey’s daughter Allie, 10, and Justin’s little half-sibs Jazmyn, 9, and Jaxon, 8. And Selena was impressed by what she saw from her man. “Selena thinks Justin will make a great dad,” the source says. “He’s a total natural with children. And Selena adores kids, too. Despite their ups and downs, Selena and Justin are in a great place right now.”

Last week, fans completely lost their minds when Selena posted a birthday tribute to Justin on Instagram. Not only was her message super cute — yet incredibly subtle — but also the first time the “Bad Liar” singer has publicly acknowledged the pair’s rekindled love. “March 1, 1994 someone I know that happens to be super cool was born. Boom,” she wrote in the caption.

Selena’s comments section was flooded with completely shocked fans. “I was tearing up when I saw #jelena4lyfe,” one person shared. Another said, “Yes yes yes yes my favorite people ever, so sweet.” And one fan legitimately couldn’t contain their excitement as they wrote, “I’M SCREAMING.”

#Jelena4evs. And TBH, that would be one cute baby, so we’re all about it. Sorry, Selena’s mom!
