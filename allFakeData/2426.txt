Why Kris Jenner Chose To Share Photos From Her Mammogram On Social Media

"I spent my morning at Cedars Sinai Medical Center with this little baby today," Jenner wrote to caption a photo of her mammogram machine, encouraging others to get the exam. "So important and can save lives."

Jenner also pointed out that her mother is a breast cancer survivor, "and so are dozens of my friends." According to the American Cancer Society, there are currently more than 3.1 million breast cancer survivors in the United States.
