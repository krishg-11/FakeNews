Wasting Away? Selena Gomez On A Mission To Be A Size Zero!

An insider has revealed to OK! exclusively about Selena’s ever shrinking figure. “Her waist is teeny and she’s dropped at least two dress sizes recently, everyone’s worried.”

Her focus seems to be on not eating that much and putting way too much energy into her fitness. "She barely touches her meals and works out like a fiend every day, often fitting two or three sessions into one day,” says the source.

Even though she enjoys how she looks, she seems far from done in her quest for being super thin. "She loves looking skinny but says she’s not reached her goal yet and is continuing to diet the whole time,” the source reveals.

"It’s typical of her addictive personality, once she gets onto a cycle like this she’s unable to stop,” continues the source. Is her boyfriend The Weeknd doing anything to stop this insanity?

Could this stress be due to her ex Justin Bieber trying to get back into her life? Or that The Weeknd is creating a rift between Selena and her loved ones?
