Grammy winners 2018: the complete list

The 2018 Grammys, the 60th installment of the music industry’s flagship awards show, were handed out on Sunday night. And the night belonged to Bruno Mars.

Heading into the awards, Mars and Jay-Z led the nominations. But Mars ultimately swept the three biggest honors of the night, taking home Album of the Year and Record of the Year for 24k Magic and winning Song of the Year for “That’s What I Like.”

Mars won six Grammys overall. In the end, Jay-Z was completely shut out and went home empty handed.

The Grammys handed out more than 80 golden gramophones in total, including in dozens of categories whose winners were announced shortly before the live telecast. Going into the ceremony, for example, Mars had already won three Grammys: Best R&B Album for 24K Magic and Best R&B Performance and Best R&B Song for “That’s What I Like.”

Another big winner from the preshow awards was Kendrick Lamar, who won five Grammys total: He was honored with Best Rap Song, Best Rap Performance, and Best Music Video for “HUMBLE” during the preshow, and during the main ceremony, he won Best Rap/Sung Performance for “Loyalty” with Rihanna and Best Rap Album for DAMN.

Meanwhile, other notable — and controversial — wins from the live ceremony included Alessia Cara for Best New Artist (in an unfortunate snub of SZA) and Ed Sheeran for Best Pop Solo Performance, with his song “Shape of You” (Sheeran somehow beat Kelly Clarkson, Lady Gaga, Kesha, and Pink, and he wasn’t even present to accept the award).

Below is a full list of the night’s winners in the Grammys’ televised categories. (To see the full list of preshow and televised winners in all 80-plus categories, visit the Grammys’ website.)
