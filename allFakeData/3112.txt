Jewish celebs share their thoughts on Trump inauguration

JTA — While Donald Trump’s upcoming inauguration has empowered his supporters — whom many commentators say were ignored by the Democratic party — many liberal voters are feeling extremely nervous and anxious. The latter group — unsurprisingly— contains many Jewish celebrities.

Barbra Streisand, for instance, who vocally supported Hillary Clinton throughout the presidential campaign, called the president-elect “clueless, reckless, graceless, mindless and heartless” in a Huffington Post piece on Wednesday.

“He doesn’t just bring economic policies I happen to disagree with, or an approach to healthcare funding that could hurt millions of people. This isn’t simply a matter of Republican versus Democratic. This is a man who, on record and often on video, disparaged or outright ridiculed women, immigrants, the disabled and others.”
