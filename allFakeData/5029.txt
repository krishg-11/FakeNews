The Truth About Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux's Divorce Is Downright Ugly

Soon after Justin Theroux and Jennifer Aniston announced their split, fans were determined to figure out what went wrong. Now, one month later, Life & Style has exclusively learned that he "put her through hell." And it wasn't just rough for Jen at the end of their relationship, either — apparently, they were doomed from the get-go. The source explained that Jen said, "It was never a real marriage to start with." It was a classic case of opposites attracting — she liked game nights in with her celebrity pals whereas he would rather hit the town — and the source revealed that it was soon after they started initially dating that things took a turn for the worse. "It didn't take long for their different personalities and relationship expectations to clash. They'd fight for weeks at a time!"
