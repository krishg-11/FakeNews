Kim Kardashian’s extreme 700 calorie diet to lose weight for naked shoot

Kim Kardashian is said to have undergone an extreme 700 calorie diet in an attempt to lose weight quickly.

The reality TV queen has apparently taken on the diet plan before doing a naked photo shoot.

Apparently, the mum-of-two is keen on showing off her new slimmer figure after dropping all of the baby weight she gained before giving birth to her son Saint West.

Instead of going the regular route of a balanced diet and exercise, Kim is said to be ‘obsessed’ with achieving her goal weight by any means necessary.

The 36-year-old is thought to been motivated to change her shape after unedited photos appeared of her bum while she was on holiday in Mexico last April.

According to Heat magazine, she has never been more motivated to reach her goal size.

‘After those pictures of her bikini body came out, she wanted to crawl under a rock,’ a source told the publication.

‘Kim’s obsessed with dropping more weight and won’t eat more than 700 calories a day.’

The reality star supposedly lives off of a meagre diet of egg whites and blueberries for breakfast, green vegetables for lunch and dinners consisting of sashimi (raw fish) and brocolli.

It’s not just an insane diet that has changed her appearance however, as Kim is said to have undergone surgery to transform her body in recent months.

‘Surgery is always her answer and she has recently undergone a number of figure-sculpting ops, including a boob lift, lipo, upper-arm “fat freezing”, knee tightening and a butt boost,’ the source claims.

What’s more, she is said to be considering getting Botox, fillers and laser treatments which could end up costing her around $500,000.

Kim showed off her new figure at a Balmain opening in LA last week, wearing a long skirt and a tiny crop top, which further accentuated her shrinking frame.
