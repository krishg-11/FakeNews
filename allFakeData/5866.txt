Is Meghan Markle Already Pregnant? The Evidence Speaks for Itself

Meghan has worn several Givenchy dresses since her wedding to Prince Harry. Now, the duchess could be channeling her best Audrey Hepburn by repeatedly choosing the designer's dress... but we don't think that's the case. She has worn three white Givenchy dresses in the last month. Her wedding gown, the dress for her royal engagement with the queen, and her gown for her Royal Ascot debut -- all from the same french design house.

What does this mean, exactly? Well, if the duchess is in fact pregnant, her and Harry would want to tell as little people as possible. This would cause Meghan to have the same designer dressing her for most of her royal events.

The less people that know the happy news, the less of a chance there is of word getting out!
