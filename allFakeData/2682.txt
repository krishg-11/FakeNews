Reports Claim Angelina Jolie Is Crushing On ‘Maleficent 2’ Co-Star Ed Skrein – Is He Interested?

According to new reports, Angelina Jolie has been crushing on one of her co-stars on the set of the Maleficent sequel! Apparently, the one who stole her heart is Ed Skrein, but is he interested in her as well?

‘Angie thinks Ed is hot and she loves working with him. Obviously, he is a great actor, but she is also looking forward to chatting with him behind the cameras. She would love to get to know Ed and find out what makes him tick,’ one source claims.

It is safe to say we’re totally shipping this pair!

Not only is Ed super cute and relented, but he is also a self-professed ‘family man’ and Angie had quite the big family!

While Jolie is the mother of six children, Ed is also the father of one.

He has a seven-year-old son and if they got together, they’d have a super adorable blended family.

The insider also states that Jolie had a lot to do with Ed getting the Maleficent role he is playing.

Allegedly, she was able to see his talent ‘from a mile away.’

Unfortunately, it sounds like he is not only a great actor but is also a very professional one so he’d rather not hang out with his co-stars.

‘After premiere events or parties, some of the stars are like, ‘Let’s go out,’ but I just go back to the hotel room. I’m the most boring person!’ he revealed during an interview.

Of course, that doesn’t mean Angelina will not be the one to get him out of his shell.

Besides, ‘If word gets out about her flirting with Ed, it will drive Brad nuts!’ Win-win for her, right?
