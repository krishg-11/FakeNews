Grande: 'Rihanna wasn't laughing at me'

Ariana Grande has responded to claims that Rihanna was laughing at her during her performance at last week's iHeartRadio Music Awards.

Rihanna was seen laughing when the camera cut to her table at the Los Angeles ceremony on May 1, but Grande said that the 'Diamonds' singer was "just being playful".



Appearing on Australia's The Bump Show, the DJ told Grande: "[Rihanna] wasn't laughing at you, she was laughing at something your best friend said."

The host asked: "I know you guys caught up afterwards, did she clarify that?"

Grande explained: "I didn't see her laughing at me, but when I watched it afterwards it looked like she was just shocked because I was doing something different.

"Afterwards she was so kind to me, she was like, 'Lil' mama keep doing what you're doing because it's working.'"

The 'Problem' singer said that she "thought it was funny that people tried to make such a commotion out of it".

"She was just being playful and supportive. People are always trying to make a big deal out of nothing because they're bored," the 20-year-old added.
