We knew it already, but Julia Louis-Dreyfus is beloved, both in Hollywood and in Washington, D.C.

The actress, who picked up her record-setting sixth consecutive Emmy win earlier in September for "Veep," announced she had breast cancer on Thursday, and ever since then social media has been lighting up with expressions of support and affection, including one very special one:

We Veeps stick together. Jill and I, and all of the Bidens, are with you, Julia. pic.twitter.com/JP0c2wtrJ6 — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 28, 2017

As you may recall, the former vice president made a madcap "Veep"-themed video with Louis-Dreyfus in 2014 for the White House Correspondents' Dinner, and the duo shared a meal or two along the way. So of course Louis-Dreyfus made sure to tweet him back:

But Biden was far from the only politico to reach out via social media:

Julia, you're in our thoughts and our hearts. Inspired but not surprised to see you using your platform for good in this difficult moment. — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 28, 2017

And Meghan McCain, the newly-announced "View" co-host and daughter of Senator John McCain, wrote: "Sending so much love and strength to Julia Louis-Dreyfus @OfficialJLD and her family."

Of course, her co-workers past and present stepped up with condolences and good wishes:

@OfficialJLD so sorry you have to go thru this, pal, but I know you will prevail. We are here if/when you need and we love you. ️ — jason alexander (@IJasonAlexander) September 29, 2017

While fellow former "Seinfeld" star Michael Richards told People magazine, "I wish Julia godspeed and a full recovery."

And "Pitch Perfect" star Anna Kendrick wrote, "I don't think I realized how much I love this woman, who I don't know. Love her more for speaking up for others in this moment."

Meanwhile, at least one fan has visited Louis-Dreyfus' star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, only to find it decorated with kind words and stickers, which we heartily endorse:

Good luck on fighting this, Julia, and get well soon!
