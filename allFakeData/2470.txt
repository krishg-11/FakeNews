The Lighthouse (2019)

Trivia

Pattinson and Dafoe reached out to Robert Eggers to work with them because they loved The Witch (2015). So when Eggers finished the script, it was always clear to him to cast them because he had been looking for a project to do with both. Before this movie, Eggers talked with Pattinson about other roles in films (including The Knight, and Nosferatu). See more
