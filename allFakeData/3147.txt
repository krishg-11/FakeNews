AceShowbiz - %cBillie Lourd% is coping very well following the loss of her mom %cCarrie Fisher% and grandma %cDebbie Reynolds%. It's all thanks to her boyfriend %cTaylor Lautner% who is doing his best to help Billie enjoy herself with a trip to Cabo San Lucas.

Rumor has it, Billie wants to tie the knot with Taylor, just a month after the loss of her loved ones. However, some think the 24-year-old actress is getting too close to the "Twilight" actor too quickly and she needs time to breathe.

"Carrie and Debbie were everything to Billie. Now she has this huge hole in her life and we are worried that she will rush into marriage with Taylor to fill it," a friend tells Naughty Gossip, "He is a great guy, but she needs to take a little time before she rushes into any life changing decision. The family wishes that she takes her time and makes no major decisions while she is still grieving."

Earlier this month, Billie and Taylor were photographed holding hands while they enjoyed some quiet pool time together in Cabo San Lucas. They entered to take a dip and smiled while looking at their phones together.
