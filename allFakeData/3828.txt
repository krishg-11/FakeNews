A source close to the movie revealed to the Daily Mirror: 'Madonna is not supporting the film yet but the makers are hoping to cast someone who she will love.

'At the moment they are in talks with Paris. If she agrees it will be a massive coup for Â­producers as Madonna is a big fan of Paris.'

However, Madonna is apparently not on board with the film and previously criticised the script.

It is set in 1980s New York and follows Madonna's rise to fame and the release of her self-titled smash hit debut album.

But Madonna said: 'Why would Universal Studios want to make a movie about me based on a script that is all lies?'

During an epic Carpool Karaoke session with James Corden, the 58-year-old confessed she 'tongue in mouth kissed' the late singer.

The photoshoot, which appeared in the April 2017 edition of Harper's Bazaar, caused a fan frenzy on social media at the time.

Even Paris was struck by the resemblance, sharing a fan made collage of photos of herself and Madonna side by side on Twitter, captioned, '@Madonna some of the edits people send me get pretty wild but i'm kinda starting to dig it'.

Paris has branched out into acting of late and received rave reviews for her debut acting performance in the American TV series Star.

The Fox show is centred on three women who form their own pop group while Paris played a social media guru.
