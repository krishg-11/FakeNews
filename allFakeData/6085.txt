Taylor Swift Gets No Love From Her Former Girl Squad On Her Birthday

But Karlie Kloss came to the rescue to wish happy birthday to the singer with a cute selfie snap. T-Swift is now 28-years-old.

While Taylor already was losing friends, according to reports, one of her latest singles, "Look What You Made Me Do," didn't help matters at all, as she called out Kanye West, Katy Perry, and others, reportedly leaving a former friend, Kendall Jenner, furious.

“Since Taylor’s been in hiding Kendall’s very much the queen bee these days, so what she says goes for the majority of that group. She’s made it clear that anyone listening or supporting Taylor will be banned from her circle instantly, and the likes of Gigi, Bella and Cara are all doing as they’re told," a source said.

Guess it doesn't always pay off to stay off of social media!

But at least Karlie still is backing Taylor, even if everyone else is remaining silent on her birthday. Looks like Taylor is going to have to find some new A-list pals!
