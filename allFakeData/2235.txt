Katie Holmes NOT Pregnant And Planning Wedding With Jamie Foxx

Katie Holmes is not pregnant with Jamie Foxx’s baby, nor are the two planning a wedding together, despite a completely made-up tabloid report. Gossip Cop has repeatedly debunked rumors of the two getting married and starting a family, and we can do so yet again.

According to OK!, those close to the actor and actress believe she’s expecting his child, which will lead to the two walking down the aisle. A so-called “source” tells the magazine, “Katie is very traditional and has old-fashioned values. She’s made it clear to Jamie that there’s no way she would have a baby out of wedlock. He’ll be expected to step up to the plate.”

The outlet’s seemingly bogus insider adds, “With their romance finally out in the open they can start planning a future and stop all the tiptoeing around. Katie sees Jamie as perfect daddy material, and husband material too.” But as Gossip Cop has repeatedly noted, Foxx and Holmes only casually date. The two aren’t in a serious or committed relationship.
