Celebrities React to Chuck Berry’s Death: ‘Hail to the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll’

Hollywood and the music industry flocked to social media on Saturday after news broke that legendary musician Chuck Berry had died.

Berry, a rock ‘n’ roll pioneer known for songs including “Maybellene,” “Roll Over Beethoven” and “Johnny B. Goode,” was found unresponsive by the St. Charles County police and pronounced dead minutes later.

The Twitter account managed by the estate of John Lennon tweeted out a quote, “If you had to give Rock ‘n’ Roll another name, you might call it Chuck Berry.”
