Taylor Swift Slams Kanye West & Kim Kardashian In New Diss Track

She sings, “It was so nice being friends again/ There I was giving you a second chance/ But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand."

As fans know, the two have been feuding on-and-off since 2009, after Kanye ruined Taylor’s shine at the MTV Video Music Awards, saying Beyonce should have won the award for Best Female Video.

Fast forward seven years, and a few apologies later, and Kanye releases his hit song “Famous” which includes lyrics “I feel like me and Tayor might still have sex/ Why? I made that b**** famous.” He claimed to have sought Taylor’s approval before using her in the song, but her camp denied it.

And Taylor wasn’t done on the song, as she also references the phone call that Kim claimed to have recorded with Taylor approving the lyrics. The pop star sings, “And therein lies the issue/Friends don’t try to trick you/Get you on the phone and mind-twist you/And so I took an ax to a mended fence.” Yikes.

She even goes as far as to diss Kanye for no longer having Jay Z on his side, after the two had a falling out reportedly over money as well as Kanye’s relationship with Kim. Taylor sings, “But I’m not the only friend you’ve lost lately/Mm mmm/If only you weren’t so shady.”
