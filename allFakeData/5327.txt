Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth Wedding Rumors Fueled by Matching Rings

Miley Cyrus was spotted—totally pants-less—in Savana, Georgia on a coffee run with fiancé (or husband, as many suspect), Liam Hemsworth. The rumor mill has recently been claiming that the pair secretly wed in a private ceremony nearly seven months ago and simply never made an announcement to the public.

For the morning coffee date (where they were met by Miley’s mom, Trish), Miley chose an oversized pullover that made her look totally pants-less. Though it’s unclear whether she was sporting some shorts underneath, they would have to be pretty micro-mini, as there was no hint of anything peeking out of the bottom of her already short tunic top. She kicked her look up a notch with classic black Dr. Martens (which you can buy here).

Both the 24-year-old singer and her 27-year-old beau are still sporting rings on THAT finger, further leading to speculation that the pair have secretly said their vows. For such a photographed couple, however, we kind of love the prospect that they call each other husband and wife and the public is none the wiser.
