Crushing On Chris! Inside Angelina Jolie's Secret Plan To Woo Heartthrob Hemsworth It was 'no accident' the famous pair were seated together at the Golden Globes.

A year-and-a-half after her divorce from Brad Pitt, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal Angelina Jolie has her eyes set on Hollywood’s hottest hunk — Chris Hemsworth!

The A-list actress is said to be begging her team to cast her in a movie alongside the Thor heartthrob after she was seen cozying up to him at the Golden Globes.

A source tells Radar it was “no accident” that Jolie, 42, was seated next to Hemsworth, 34, at the star-studded event. “She really admires his work and thinks he’s a fantastic actor, so she’d like to star together in a movie in the near future.”

“Angie is preparing to get back in front of the camera and would love to work on another action film, with Chris as her hunky leading man!” snitches the informant.

While the couple would undoubtedly make a good paring for a movie together, sources claim “the whole thing is pretty fishy.”

“It hasn’t gone unnoticed that Angie swoons whenever she’s in Chris’ presence, and there’s growing talk she’s using this as a way of getting closer to him.”

As Radar previously reported exclusively, Angie was most recently linked to 38-year-old Cambodian rapper and filmmaker praCH Ly — who is a superstar in his homeland — after being introduced by their mutual friend Loung Ung.

But it appears she’s already moved on from Ly as she has her eyes set on Hemsworth!
