Selena Gomez officially dumps Justin Bieber

Seeing the couple back together in October 2017 was exciting for the majority of us that have always dreamed of their reunion... but if we're being honest with ourselves, we always knew they're just not good together.

Selena's friends and family insisted on that too, and it looks like she finally listened to them because she's ended things for good.

"Selena started seeing the bigger picture when it came to their relationship," a source tells Us Weekly. "Like what was more important: her general happiness and her family and friends approval, or her being together with Justin, where no one really supported their relationship.

"She obviously chose happiness and her friends and family and is so thrilled about her decision-making process," the source continues. "She feels more empowered than ever and is looking forward to this next chapter."

Good for you Sel!

After the pair went on a break earlier this year, Justin was spotted on several occasions with model Baskin Champion, which pretty much proved that he hadn't changed one bit since they began dating in 2009.

RIP Jelena.
