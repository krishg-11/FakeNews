Kris & Caitlyn Jenner ‘Terrified’ Over OJ Simpson’s Prison Release

Kris & Caitlyn Jenner ‘Terrified’ About O.J. Simpson’s Prison Release, SOURCE CLAIMS ‘They want him to stay far, far away from their family forever!’

O.J. Simpson was granted parole today from prison in Nevada after serving nine years for an armed robbery, and RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that the KUWTK clan is “terrified!”

“Kris is completely beside herself right now and was hoping that O.J. would be locked away forever,” a Kardashian family insider claimed.

Our snitch spills, “She [Kris] was hoping that she would never have to see him for the rest of her life and she despises O.J. more than anyone!”

As the world knows, Jenner, 61, was best friends with Simpson’s ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, who was brutally murdered at her home in Los Angeles in 1992.

Although Jenner’s ex-husband, the late Robert Kardashian Sr. – who is the father of Kim, 36, Kourtney, 38, and Khloe, 33 – was part of the legal “Dream Team” that got Simpson cleared of the murder conviction, the 61-year-old momager and her ex, Caitlyn Jenner, 67, both believe that Simpson is guilty of Brown’s murder.

“Kris and Caitlyn both believe that he killed Nicole and they are terrified that he will come after them now that he is out,” the insider told Radar, adding that Caitlyn, “is especially concerned because of what she wrote about O.J. in her recent memoir!”

“O.J.’s release may bring Kris and Caitlyn closer because they spent many years fearing him for what they believe he did to Nicole. They want him to stay far, far away from their family forever!”
