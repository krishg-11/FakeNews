Inside Matt Damon's Falling Out With Ben Affleck Over His New Relationship

The actor literally "can't stand" the SNL producer, who started dating Ben shortly after it was confirmed Ben and Jennifer Garner were over.

And one of the reasons is because he feels she doesn't "measure up to Jennifer. He thinks she is controlling and manipulative and that she's bad news for Ben because she like to drink and Ben shouldn't be around that."

Ben went to rehab three times, the third time being in secret, according to RadarOnline. And his ex-wife is the one who encouraged him to get help again.

Due to the Matt not liking Lindsay, he and Ben ended up having arguments about the relationship.

Matt’s bummed” says the insider. “He hopes Ben eventually comes to his senses.”
