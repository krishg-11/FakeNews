First of all how does an 18 year old kid come to know about such a drug unless he's experiencing hair problems himself? Anyway, after reading about this I did some research and I've come to the conclusion that he is to be balding or at least battling it.



Both his maternal grandfather and father himself have absolutely no hair, they're completely bald yet he has somehow maintained a NW0?

Not only this but he's recently shaved and bleached his hair which may be due to the start of thinning/recession? Perhaps there's more going on here than the eye deceives...
