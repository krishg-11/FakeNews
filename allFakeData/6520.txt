Two years into a relationship with her boyfriend, actress Vanessa Kirby was shocked to wake up one day and find out she was married to Tom Cruise.

While filming “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” with 56-year-old Cruise last spring, paparazzi caught the co-stars kissing on set and the tabloids went wild.

“Even though the [film] crew were there, it was all [in the tabloids] like, ‘The next wife falls at his feet,'” Kirby, 30, told Marie Claire UK in a new interview. “The most disconcerting thing was the people I didn’t think would believe it, did, and they were texting my boyfriend, asking, ‘Are you OK?’ I don’t think they believe anything they read now because you just can’t.

“None of it is real,” Kirby added. “To be getting married to him? Not even a snog, it was marriage.”

“The Crown” actress has been dating actor Callum Turner for two years and plans to keep that part of her life private.

“I’ve been lucky because I barely get recognized, and I keep my relationship super private,” Kirby shared. “[Turner is] just completely wonderful and he’s my best friend, so that’s … I guess you can either choose to talk about it or not.”

She added, “If you talk about it, it becomes interesting to people, but if you don’t, then it’s not.”
