A thorough investigation into the theories that "prove" Khloe Kardashian isn't pregnant.

There are some things in life we humans accept to be true.

The sky is blue. The earth is round. Bachelor in Paradise is kinda weird.

Khloe Kardashian being pregnant, it would seem, is not one of them. Yes, that’s right.

Despite the fact the 33-year-old appears to be very, very with child – literally WEEKS from popping out a tiny infant – the internet is building a case to support their unusual theory that Khloe has been faking her pregnancy for months on her momager Kris’ orders in the name of publicity.

We are 99.83 per cent sure this theory is completely and utterly bogus. But that .17 per cent of us that lives for these kinds of wild conspiracies urged us to sort through all the facts for ourselves.

Thus began our investigation into whether one Khloe Alexandra Kardashian is actually pregnant.

Part One: The initial reports from Blind Gossip.

This theory all began with a single report from gossip website Blind Gossip saying the reason for Khloe’s delayed pregnancy confirmation was because she was not really with child.

“People think that she is just waiting to be safe before she confirms the pregnancy. She actually is not even pregnant! She is just stretching out the rumours as long as possible because of publicity,” the site reported a source said.

Credible, no?

Logical explanation:

Thankfully we didn’t have to dig too deep to figure this one out.

Khloe explained exactly why she kept her pregnancy news to herself for so long in an Instagram post in December 2017, saying “we wanted to enjoy this between our family and close friends as long as we could privately. To enjoy our first precious moments just us.”

Fair enough.
