But has the I Tonya actress got even more news for us?

According to reports, the 27 year old is pregnant with her first child.

NW magazine claim she debuted her bump on the red carpet at the Hollywood Film Awards, earlier this month, opting for a ‘billowy’ dress to cover her figure.

"Someone was overheard saying Margot wanted something billowy to wear that hid her mid-section," an insider reportedly told the publication.

"Margot has wanted to be a mum ever since she and Tom tied the knot and she's always said that that when she does get pregnant she'll keep the news to herself and her closest family members."

However, the former Neighbours star has yet to confirm or deny any rumours on social media.

Margot recently opened up about married life, after tying the knot with her British filmmaker beau, last December.

Speaking to Vogue, she admitted nothing had changed between the pair following their nuptials.

"We were best friends and roommates before and now we’re like best friends and roommates still, so nothing’s really changed at all," she explained.

"Other than the fact that I get to wear this on the weekends," she joked about her huge diamond ring.

"I can’t obviously wear it during the week when I’m working – I don’t want to lose it on set." she added.

OK! Online has contacted Margot’s reps for a comment.
