American Music Awards Nominations 2017: AMAs Nominees Full List

The 2017 American Music Awards were announced on Thursday, and Gossip Cop has a full list of this year’s nominees. Check out the list below!

At the American Music Awards, a variety of chart-dominating artists will be honored in multiple categories, covering almost every genre of music. Ciara, a two-time AMA nominee, had the honor of revealing some of this year’s nominations for the 45th annual ceremony on “Good Morning America.” The remaining nominations will be announced via Facebook Live on the American Music Awards and Billboard pages, which is slated to begin at around 9:50 a.m. ET.

Nominations are based on sales data, radio airplay, social media activity, touring and more, but it’s typically up to the fans to determine the winners of each category through online voting. This year’s contenders for the biggest award of the night, Artist of The Year, are Bruno Mars, The Chainsmokers, Drake, Kendrick Lamar and Ed Sheeran. Of course, Ariana Grande scored the highest honor in 2016.
