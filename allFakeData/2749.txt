Caitlyn Jenner Slams the Kardashians, Says She Didn't Trust Them to Know About Her Gender Reassignment Surgery

Caitlyn Jenner made a recent appearance on Piers Morgan’s Life Stories, and was asked about gender reassignment surgery.

If you didn’t know, Caitlyn wrote in her autobiography, “The Secrets Of My Life,” that she had undergone “the final surgery,” but would not elaborate further. On the show, Caitlyn told Piers that she did not want to tell the Kardashians about her surgery.

“I didn’t tell anybody [about the surgery]. It’s none of their businesses. I had already been living as Caitlyn for a year and a half, OK? I didn’t want them to leak it to the press, OK? There was no reason for them to know about it, of course I didn’t trust them,” Caitlyn said.

She added about her current relationship with the Kardashians, “I don’t talk to the Kardashians anymore. The only ones I am concerned about are Kendall and Kylie. They are my biological kids. I spent 23 years carting them around.”
