After denying that they’re romantically involved, Sienna Miller has once again been getting cozy with Brad Pitt, according to reports.

Page Six reported in April that Miller and the soon-to-be-divorced Pitt were spotted doing some “serious flirting” at a Hollywood dinner.

But Miller told us soon after that news of their mutual attraction was “silly.”

Now The Sun reports that Miller and Pitt — whose production company, Plan B, produced her latest movie, “The Lost City Of Z” — were “seen holding hands and stroking each other during a late night party” at the Glastonbury music festival in the UK over the weekend.

The paper reports that “the A-listers met up at 3 a.m. on Saturday morning in the festival’s exclusive Rabbit Hole area before retiring to their VIP Winnebago.”

When we asked Miller about the romance in April, she told us, “I’m not going to even dignify it with a response. It’s predictable and silly.”
