Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott have reportedly split after 2 years together. Here's a complete timeline of their relationship.

March 2017: Jenner ended her long-term relationship with Tyga.

Rumors began to swirl when fans realized Tyga had not made an appearance on Jenner's social media since Valentine's Day of that year. An anonymous source told HollywoodLife that Jenner had dumped the pseudo-rapper because she was "bored" with the "dead end" relationship.

Later in the month, Tyga's ex-fianceé Blac Chyna heavily suggested in a Snapchat rant that he had been cheating on Jenner, as reported by Cosmopolitan.

"Multiple sources" confirmed the split to People in early April. At the time, these sources framed the break-up as a brief separation — which seemed consistent with the couple's on-and-off relationship.

"They tend to take little breaks all the time and then get back together," says one insider. "It's definitely possible they'll work things out again."

Jenner later opened up about the split on an episode of "Life of Kylie," stating that the two will "always have a bond."

"There was absolutely nothing wrong with me and T," she revealed. "There was no crazy fight. We decided — well, I decided — that I'm really young. I don't want to look back in five years from now and feel like he took something from me, when he's really not that type of person."
