Olivia Munn and Aaron Rodgers are both supportive of one another's careers.

For the "Newsroom" actress, that means respecting that her boyfriend, the quarterback for the Green Bay Packers, has a lot on his mind come game day. Having sex, she told Bravo's Andy Cohen, is off the table.

"Not on game day," she said, during an appearance on "Watch What Happens Live." "There's not a rule, but it just doesn't happen because there's other things to focus on."

But sleeping together after the game is a possibility, she dished.

"Depends on how late the game is," she said, later adding, "I try to have sex as much as I can."

Munn, 34, and Rodgers, 31, were first linked earlier this year. And while some have credited her influence on Rodgers for his great stats this season, she brushes off the compliment.

"All the good luck charms are on the field and in the stands," she said. "It has nothing to do with me."
