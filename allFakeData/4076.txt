2016 Can Suck Everything: Angelina Jolie Has Filed for Divorce from Brad Pitt

Holy … what is happening, 2016?

TMZ reports that Angelina Jolie just filed for divorce from Brad Pitt, reportedly over his parenting and “interaction with their children.”

Sources connected with the couple tell us … Angelina’s decision to file has to do with the way Brad was parenting the children … she was extremely upset with his methods. We’re told there was no alleged ‘third person’ … her decision to file was solely over Brad’s interaction with their children.

That “alleged ‘third party'” business may be due to recent tabloid fodder about Brad supposedly being involved with — depending upon which trashy source you read — Marion Cotillard or Gwyneth Paltrow. Personally, I think those rumors are swirling because a) Cotillard is Pitt’s most recent costar, and b) people have always wanted Brad and Gwynnie to get back together.

Whatever the actual reason, I’m sad for them and even more sad for their brood. Their lovely family brought us all a little bit of joy.

I …

RIP Brangelina.

… I don’t know how to feel about anything anymore.

I request that you please respect my need for gifs during this difficult time, and respond only in such a manner.

*Update: The TMZ piece now lists anger and substance abuse (in addition to the parenting issues) among the alleged grounds:
