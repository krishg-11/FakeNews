Gwen Stefani had to bow out of her scheduled headlining performance at the annual Keep Memory Alive: Power of Love Gala after rupturing her eardrum, event organizers told attendees mid-show Thursday evening.

Sources tell PEOPLE that the change of plans wasn’t revealed ahead of the gala at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.

Larry Ruvo, the president of Keep Memory Alive – which supports the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health – announced that Stefani wouldn’t be making it due to a “ruptured eardrum” about an hour into the show.

Instead, attendees watched a video message from Stefani, 47, apologizing for her absence. Singer Jennifer Hudson replaced her at the event.

According to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, manager Irving Azoff told Ruvo that Stefani was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on Tuesday, and advised not to fly or sing. However, a source tells PEOPLE that although Stefani sought medical attention at the hospital, she wasn’t admitted.

Stefani hasn’t yet addressed her condition publicly, and a rep for the singer did not immediately return request for comment. Stefani is next set to appear live Monday on The Voice.
