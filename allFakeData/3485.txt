Caitlyn Jenner to Trump: What happened to your promise to fight for LGBT Americans?

Olympic gold medalist and transgender activist Caitlyn Jenner on Wednesday slammed President Trump’s call to ban transgender people from serving in the military, asking what happened to his promise to fight for the LGBT community.

“There are 15,000 patriotic transgender Americans in the US military fighting for all of us. What happened to your promise to fight for them?” Jenner tweeted.

Jenner quoted a June 2016 Trump tweet where he thanked the LGBT community and said he will “fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs.”

Trump on Wednesday tweeted that he would ban transgender people from any military service. He said he made the decision after consulting with “generals and military experts.”

Last year, the Obama administration lifted the previous ban, allowing transgender troops to serve openly.

“After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military," Trump tweeted.

"Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you," he added.

Jenner, who voted for President Trump, has previously said that though she backs the GOP, she will “come after” anyone who does not support LGBT rights.
