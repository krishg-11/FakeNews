EXCLUSIVE: Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban are moving back to Australia

"She and Keith have always said they'd eventually settle here, they were just waiting for the right time." And it appears that time is now. Nicole has found huge success in home-grown projects including award-winning film Lion and acclaimed TV series Top of the Lake: China Girl. Having been showered with praise for the roles both here and overseas, she says it's important to her that she continues to support the Australian film and television industry.

Nicole would love to raise Sunday and Faith Down Under.

"I'm as definite as you can be in this world and this life," she says of her plans to take on more work Down Under. "There is hopefully more to come (in Australia). I hope that is not it. There is a lot of things still happening... it is exciting." Also making the journey home more pressing is the fact that Sunday Rose and Faith Margaret are inching ever closer to their high school years.

Nic and Keith, pictured sharing a kiss during Oprah's tour of Oz in 2010, are hoping to do some house hunting when they return to Sydney for the holidays.
