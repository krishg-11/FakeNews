Cameron Diaz, Jim Carrey ditch reunion movie plans

Cameron Diaz and Jim Carrey have scrapped plans to reunite in the romantic comedy A Little Game just a few weeks before shooting was due to start, movie industry press reported Tuesday.

Diaz and Carrey had been due to appear on screen for the first time since starring in 1994's The Mask, but pulled out because of unhappiness with the storyline, The Hollywood Reporter and Variety said.

Filming had been set to start this month, the report said.

The movie, which has also seen Italian director Gabriele Muccino exit at the 11th hour, is a remake of the French film Un petit jeu sans conséquence, based on a play by Jean Dell and Gérald Sibleyras. AFP
