Kylie Jenner's Lip Kits Sold Out Again and the Internet is Livid

While Kylie Jenner was still dreaming about Tyga Monday morning, her Lip Kits were restocked — then sold out — in a matter of seconds.

Khloé Kardashian and Kris Jenner both posted photos on Instagram early Monday, reminding the world that we had yet another chance to get our hands on the kit, after it sold out almost instantly two weeks ago.

Kylie, however, was apparently still hitting snooze — she didn’t post about it at all. Instead, she shared a photo of herself still in bed two hours later, wrapped in a warm fur blanket, captioned “Morning” with a smiley face.

Yet again, Lip Kit shoppers were faced with the sad realization there weren’t enough sets to go around — the brand has since announced that the lip kits are tragically sold out.

And it’s no surprise that Kardashian fans aren’t delighted by the development.
