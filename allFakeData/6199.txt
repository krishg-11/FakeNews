Katy Perry Accidentally Let It Slip That She's Dating Orlando Bloom ... Again

Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom in a nutshell: on again, off again ... on again.

In the latest chapter of Perry and Bloom's will they/won't they relationship, the two have seemingly reconciled. How do we know this? Well, Perry might have accidentally let that one slip while judging American Idol this week.

The singer confirmed her relationship status while joking with Bachelorette star Becca Kufrin about being "in the running" for her hand.

“I’m not single but I still like you," Perry quipped, accidentally cluing the world into her dating life.

Of course, Bloom was not specifically mentioned, but the two have been spending an awful lot of time together lately. Last month, they even traveled to Rome together to meet Pope Francis (casual), where Perry referred to Bloom as "my darling" on her Instagram Story.

Bloom made it clear then that the love is mutual.

“She’s a remarkable human being, actually,” Bloom told U.K. newspaper The Times in April. “I wouldn’t have imagined anything happening. And, you know, when you get hit sideways you get hit sideways,” he continued. “You don’t pick who you fall in love with.”

Guess their romance is alive and well.
