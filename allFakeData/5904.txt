Vanessa Hudgens Addresses Speculation She's Engaged to Austin Butler

Not so fast...

The Twittersphere went into overdrive after Vanessa Hudgens posted an Instagram photo on Sunday and fans were quick to notice that the actress, who is in a relationship with actor Austin Butler, was wearing a big ring on that finger.

But it turns out that sometimes a ring on a ring finger is just a convenient place to place your baubles after an exhausting day on set.

On Tuesday, Vanessa took to Twitter to clarify the Internet sleuths' find and explain the sitch: "Guysssss. Iâ€™m not engaged! I posted a pic. Not to show off my ring that I happened to throw on that finger after a long day of filming but to show off my haircut Lol."

Oh oops! Cute haircut, V-Hudge!
