Tabloid: Kristen Stewart Pregnant with Robert Pattinson's Baby

Let's hope that Robert Pattinson isn't giving in to the temptation of Remember Me co-star Emile de Ravin. Why?

Because Kristen Stewart is pregnant with Pattinson's baby!!! If the cover story in an Australian tabloid is to be believed, that is.

According to Newsweekly, the actress asked a friend to buy her a pregnancy test last week. Describing Stewart as "nervous about the whole situation," the magazine's source would not definitively state that Kristen is actually knocked up.

Instead, the publication emphasizes that Pattinson and Stewart - who haven't even gone public with their rumored romance - are "now facing the toughest challenge to their relationship as they struggle with the news they could be parents."

Then again, of course, they could not be.

Kristen Stewart might be pregnant; Britney Spears is getting married, Jennifer Aniston is still crying over Brad Pitt and Michael Jackson may have been murdered. Dynamite reporting, Newsweekly!

Talk of romance between Pattinson and Stewart has been rampant, ever since the release of Twilight.

Some insiders claim these stars are simply friends, while other tabloids publish headlines that scream about their obsession with each other. What is the truth?

We may never know. But it's gonna take more than a report by some random publication in Australia to convince us of the pair's impending parenthood.

Do you agree? Or do you think Robert and Kristen should start picking out baby names?
