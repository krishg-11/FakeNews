Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx rumours have been rumbling around for well over a year now.

And the latest sensational claim is that Katie is pregnant with the actor’s child.

Not only is she around four months along, she’s also apparently called off their wedding, according to US OK! magazine.

The latest cover reads: “Jamie’s confession that changed everything.”

Inside a source alleges that Jamie wanted to put off the nuptials “until they’d settle into life with a new baby”.

That was said to have upset mum-of-one Katie, 37, who then decided to cancel it altogether.

"It’s understandable Katie would start to feel insecure about the relationship,” the source goes on.

"And she definitely wouldn’t want to raise another child on her own, as she’s been forced to do with Suri since she left Tom [Cruise].”

Rubbishing the reports, Katie’s spokesperson told Mirror Celebs that the story is “categorically untrue”.

While last year Jamie himself denying the persistent rumours and said they had started causing him problems with his actual girlfriend.

When quizzed about Katie during an appearance on Dish Nation , he said that she was an “old friend”.

I’m not the person who wants to be defined by anybody I date. Even if I was dating someone, no one would know anyway," he said.

“But it affects my situation because I got a girl, who’s like ‘yo, who’s this b****?’.”
