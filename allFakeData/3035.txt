Marion Cotillard Shows Off 'Rock'n Roll' Movie Makeover With 18 Selfies

If you've got it, flaunt it.

Who's that girl?

Marion Cotillard, the French actress and Dior ambassador known for her demure and ladylike style, showed off a new, um, look on Instagram on Monday — complete with a dark wavy wig and full pout — that had us wondering if she had found a long-lost Kardashian kousin.

It was the 41-year-old's plump lips (which she noted were for her role in the film, Rock'n Roll, which was released last month in France) that had her fans buzzing, with many drawing comparisons to Kylie Jenner's infamous pout, as well as the full puckers of Rose McGowan and Angelina Jolie.

However, though Cotillard made it clear that the get-up was for a role, and not a personal choice, she appeared to be feeling it.

The actress posted — count 'em — 18 selfies to give her fans a glimpse of every possible angle of the look, including several which showed off her cleavage. Cotillard, who is expecting a baby with partner Guillaume Canet (who also directed Rock'n Roll), utilized Instagram's new photo gallery feature so as not to flood fans' feeds.

The successive posts tie Rihanna's record of 18 selfies in a 24-hour period, which the singer had posted in celebration of the Crop Over festival in her native Barbados in 2015.
