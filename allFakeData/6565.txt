Taylor Swift Cuts Off Selena Gomez After Justin Bieber Reunion

If Justin Bieber is your boyfriend, Taylor Swift would let you go! The "Red" singer, 24, has distanced herself from former best friend Selena Gomez after the Disney star reconnected with her infamous ex-boyfriend, 20, sources confirm to Us Weekly.

Swift is disgusted that the pair are back together, cutting off her bestie after tweeting just last July that Gomez was "the closest thing I've ever had to a sister."

The "Boyfriend" singer sent his ex $10,000 in flowers and flew from Miami to McAllen, Texas to see her on March 7. Two days later, the "Come And Get It" crooner accompanied the Biebs to the SXSW music fest where he sang his hit "As Long as You Love Me" to her.

But Gomez rekindling of the Jelena flame isn't the only thing peeving Swift. She believes Gomez "used" a brief romance with the Grammy winner's pal Ed Sheeran last June to make her jailbird sweetie jealous.

"After Selena pulled that move, Taylor started distancing herself," a source tells Us.

And Swift has plenty of besties to spend time with otherwise. Recently she's been spotted with Modern Family's Sarah Hyland, True Grit's Hailee Steinfeld, Victoria's Secret model Karlie Kloss, and even Gomez's enemy, New Zealander Lorde. But while their friendship may be struggling, a Swift pal insists that the country artist-turned-pop vocalist loves Gomez and will always be there for her.
