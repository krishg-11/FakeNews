Emma Gonzalez Bullied School Shooter, Isn’t Sorry; Then Retweets Message Blaming “White Boys’ Entitlement” As Cause Of All School Shootings

Parkland survivor Emma Gonzalez is on video admitting to not only bullying and ostracizing the Parkland shooter, but that she was justified in doing so. Lots to dive into on this one, so let’s roll tape:

On Tuesday retweeted a message attacking ” boys” as the “most entitled demographic by far” and blaming them as the cause of all school shootings.

“[I]f bullying caused school shootings, you would see trans shooters, queer shooters, female shooters, POC shooters,” the message Gonzalez retweeted to her nearly 1.5 million Twitter followers read. “[B]ullying does not cause school shootings; entitlement does. and white boys are the most entitled demographic by far.”

white boys have been promised wealth, power, and women-as-commodity in all forms of media since childhood. and when they don't receive it, they react the way mass media has taught them: with glorious violence. — Eden Cheung (@edennnnnn) March 21, 2018

Her follow-up tweet read: “[W]hite boys have been promised wealth, power, and women-as-commodity in all forms of media since childhood. and when they don’t receive it, they react the way mass media has taught them: with glorious violence.”

The Parkland shooting had less to do with guns and more to do with governmental failure and, now according to Emma, the continued bullying of an unstable young man. Again, bullying doesn’t excuse or justify shooting up a school. Okay? Okay. But I think less bullying of students is certainly better than “We bullied him and he deserved it.” Fair?

People are responsible for their actions. The tools are not.
