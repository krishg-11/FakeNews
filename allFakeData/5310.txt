Paris Jackson Denies Relationship With Trevor Donovan

Paris Jackson is no stranger to public scrutiny, as most young celebrities are. However, after being spotted holding hands with 90210 actor Trevor Donovan in Los Angeles, the 19 year-old model and actress took to Twitter to dispel relationship rumors.

"Y'all need to chill lol hand-holding is a very common thing," she posted in a since-deleted tweet along with pictures of her holding hands with her female friends, including Sofia Richie.

Trevor, who is 38, also denied the relationship in a statement provided to Just Jared Jr.

“They are just friends,” a rep for the actor said. "Both are big animal lovers and advocates and are working on a ‘Be Pawsome, Adopt!’ campaign for local L.A. shelters.... They are friends who want to help the helpless.”

The starlet broke up with her then-boyfriend Michael Snoody last year, so while she is single, that doesn't mean she has to be cool about speculation on her love life. That said, we're glad to see that she’s not afraid to clap back.
