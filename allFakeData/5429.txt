She’s back home where she belongs.

Bette Midler steps back into the Broadway revival of Hello, Dolly! beginning July 17, reprising her Tony-winning performance as title matchmaker Dolly Gallagher Levi. Joining her is her original co-star David Hyde Pierce, who returns to the role of Horace Vandergelder.

The two succeed Bernadette Peters and Victor Garber, who joined the company in January and took their final bows at the Shubert Theatre July 15.

Midler and Pierce, who opened the production in April 2017, will play a six-week limited engagement and close out the Tony-winning revival when it shutters August 25.

The current cast also includes Tony winner Gavin Creel as Cornelius Hackl, Kate Baldwin as Irene Molloy, Charlie Stemp as Barnaby Tucker, Molly Griggs as Minnie Fay, Will Burton as Ambrose Kemper, Melanie Moore as Ermengarde, and Alli Mauzey as Ernestina.

As she did during Midler’s original run, fellow Tony winner Donna Murphy will take the stage as Dolly at select performances, playing Sunday matinees July 22–August 19, as well as August 20.
