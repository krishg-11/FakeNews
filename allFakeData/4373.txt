Robert Pattinson Flirts With A Pretty Brunette Who Is NOT FKA Twigs

The two, who began dating in 2015, have kept their relationship extremely private, which is no surprise after he was openly humiliated by his last girlfriend, Kristen Stewart, when she cheated on him with her movie director.

But it looks like Robert is the one entertaining other people now, as a source tells InTouch he flirted with a "pretty brunette" earlier this month in New York and "spent the night" hanging out with her!

But apparently he can do what he wants, as the insider adds, "Rob and FKA's engagement is off. Rob really thought he and FKA would get married, but things have changed. So he's back on the market." And it sounds like he's already found a new love connection.

So why did they split? Blame it on their career paths. "He's trying to get to a certain level of stardom, and that's kept him in LA (away from FKA) and on location more than ever."

Something tells us it may also have to do with his "best friend," Katy. A source tells OK! exclusively, “Rob’s head over heels" with her and "determined" to be with her. "Katy’s been his dream girl for years, even while he was with Kristen [Stewart]," the source claimed.
