‘Fixer Upper’ Gets November Premiere Date For Fifth & Final Season On HGTV

HGTV has slotted 9 PM Tuesday, November 21, for the fifth and final season of its hit series Fixer Upper.

Stars Joanna and Chip Gaines confirmed last month on their home-design business website Magnolia that the remodeling series, which drew more than 27.5 million viewers during its previous run, would end after the upcoming season.

Fixer Upper follows Chip and Joanna as they fix up homes in their hometown of Waco, TX.

The 19-episode Season 5 will feature more families who look to the Gaineses for help evaluating and transforming a fixer -upper into the home of their dreams. The new season also will feature special guests, including former First Lady Laura Bush and ex-football player Tim Tebow.

As previously announced, Joanna and Chip will star in new spinoff series Fixer Upper: Behind the Design, slated to premiere in May. The half-hour, behind-the-scenes companion will focus on Joanna’s process to create the designs in each Fixer Upper episode.
