They're barely talking. Eva has pushed him away," a source said.Gosling, 34, has been spending a lot of time in Georgia filming his new movie 'The Nice Guys' and 40-year-old Mendes allegedly refused to fly to Atlanta with baby Esmeralda to be with him."So instead of coming home every night to them, he's jetting back and forth just so he can see his daughter," the source added.The couple, who started dating in 2011 after filming 'A Place Beyond The Pines' together, welcomed baby Esmeralda on September 12.
