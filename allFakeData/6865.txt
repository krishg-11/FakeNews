Miranda Lambert and Anderson East Break Up: Report

One of country music's cutest couples has decided to call it quits.

After over a month of split speculation, Miranda Lambert and Anderson East have broken up, reports Us Weekly. The country couple was together for more two years.

Breakup rumors first began to swirl when fans noticed that the pair had not been active on each other's social media. The last time Anderson posted about his lady love was her birthday in November. The country gal hadn't shared any images of her main man since January.

And while both parties haven't commented about the split, some fans thought something was up when Miranda touched on some personal matters during a March 1 concert in Knoxville, Tenn. The country music superstar opened up to the crowd about her experience with heartbreak. According to Knox News, Miranda shared her perspective on the positives of a breakup.

"I make it my mission every single time I step on the stage that no matter what, no matter where I am, I want to make you feel everything you could possibly feel," the singer shared onstage. "I want you to feel sad, mad, happy and nostalgic and really pissed sometimes. That's my favorite."
