Robert Osborne: Industry Mourns ‚ÄúClass Act‚Äù & ‚ÄúTrue Gentleman‚Äù

This afternoon, Robert Osborne was trending worldwide as fans of Robert Osborne, as well as friends, mourn the death of the longtime host of Turner Classic Movies, who died Monday at 84 after suffering from undisclosed health problems. Osborne served as the face of TCM since its launch in 1994; the longtime industry columnist also authored many books on the history of the Oscars, including 1965‚Äôs Academy Awards Illustrated and The Official History of the Academy Awards.



Longtime friend Liza Minnelli said in a statement to Deadline:

‚ÄúIt was evident to anybody who watched Robert Osborne on Turner Classic Movies that his knowledge about Hollywood and film was second to none. He was an indispensable guide to viewers who tuned in everyday to hear his thoughts. Often, if I couldn‚Äôt remember the name of an actor or a particular film, I‚Äôd ring him up and he‚Äôd instantly know the answer.‚Äù

TCM shared a touching video with Osborne‚Äôs friends and colleagues; industry figures including Cher, Patton Oswalt, Patricia Arquette, Gilbert Gottfried, and others expressed their grief on social media. Watch the video here:
