Kim Kardashian Slams 'Liar' Caitlyn Jenner for Comments About Late Father Robert: 'She Is Not a Good Person'

A full season later, Caitlyn Jenner‘s memoir is still stirring up tension on Keeping Up with the Kardashians.

In a sneak peek at Sunday’s season 14 premiere, Kim and Kourtney Kardashian travel to Cleveland to visit Khloé Kardashian, who spends much of time there with her boyfriend, Cavaliers player Tristan Thompson — but they’re interrupted by a news alert about Caitlyn’s then-unreleased memoir, The Secrets of My Life.

“It says in Caitlyn’s book Robert Kardashian knew O.J. Simpson was guilty, but joined the defense team to get back at his re-married ex,” reads Kim, 36. “Robert told Caitlyn in secret after the O.J. murder trial that he believed his friend was guilty.”

“That’s not true!” interrupts Khloé, 33. “Like, what?”

“Like, to sell a book, you’re gonna make something up?” says Kourtney, 37.

“Dad so believed in him,” Kim says. “It is so shady that Caitlyn came over and gave me the book, and then on the phone she said, ‘Well, the final version has a few more things in it, but don’t worry, it’s nothing about you.’ So she lied to me, because that is about me, if it’s about our dad.”

“I have always had Caitlyn’s back,” she tells her sisters. “But she is a liar. She is not a good person.”
