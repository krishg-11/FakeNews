Hemsworth also touched on another issue that affects many couples: how to divide up responsibilities, and who might have to give something up in order to maintain the partnership. "In terms of work, she’s certainly given up more than I have," he told the magazine. "She’d like me to step back and be at home with the kids more, and of course, I want that too. But I feel like I’m at this crucial point in my career – I’ve just got to set up for longevity or I’ll slip off."
