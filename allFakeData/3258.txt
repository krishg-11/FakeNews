Kanye West Wants Donald Trump to Be Chicago’s Godfather (EXCLUSIVE)





We miss the old Kanye… Ahead of the release of his new album, Kanye West has been tweeting non-stop and proclaiming his love for Donald Trump. Now, it is being revealed he has a big request for the President — and it involves his youngest daughter Chicago.

“Kanye’s infatuated with Trump and is considering asking POTUS to be Chicago’s godfather,” a source told In Touch exclusively. “He loves, respects, and admires Trump and feels a man of his prestige and power would be a perfect influence in children’s lives.”

However, his wife Kim Kardashian is completely opposed to the idea. “She despises Trump and doesn’t like what he stands for and is telling Kanye that he needs to choose somebody else. Kanye’s adamant that he wants to ask Trump and it’s resulted in them having a huge blowout argument,” the source added. “Trump is a huge no no for Kim but Kanye’s really a huge fan and supporter of his and that’s a bone of contention in their marriage.”

In case you were wondering, North and Saint West‘s godmothers are Khloé and Kourtney Kardashian, respectively. However, their godfathers have never been revealed.

Earlier this week, it was reported that friends were worried the “Faded” rapper are worried about his current mental health after he spoke with radio host Ebro and allegedly said he loved Trump — along with claim he had an opioid addiction. On Twitter, Kanye has denied the allegations.

“There’s been a lot of fake news so I just wanted to give you the facts,” he wrote. “Yeezy will become the biggest apparel company in human history by working with the most genius level talents and creating product at an affordable price. I hired the head of supply chain from the Gap.” He also called himself this generation’s “Ford Hughes Jobs Disney.”

Let’s hope Kim wins this godfather battle.
