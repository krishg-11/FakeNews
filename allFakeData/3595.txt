No, Angelina Jolie Did Not See The Tomb Raider Reboot

Although she is a household name now and the perpetual focus of celebrity coverage, there was a time when Angelina Jolie's star was much dimmer. The Oscar-winning actress really became a big name thanks to her starring role in the video game adaptation, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider. The actress starred as Lara Croft in two films that still stand as some of the few decent video game movies. Many people still identify Angelina Jolie with the role, so you might think that she would want to check out the reboot starring Alicia Vikander, which debuted in theaters last weekend. Well, despite earlier reports to the contrary, it seems that Angelina Jolie did not take her kids to see Tomb Raider, as they saw Love, Simon instead.
