What Katy Perry Did With This Gift John Mayer Sent Her Is Straight Up SAVAGE

She's a savage! John Mayer still refuses to give up on Katy Perry and he took her recent breakup from Orlando Bloom as bait to get her back, but the strong-willed singer wasn't having it! Sources tell OK! magazine exclusively that John sent Katy 100 roses after the breakup, along with a card that read, "I'm here for you." But Katy gave her playboy ex's bouquet the brush-off, telling an assistant to donate it to a nursing home and sending him a photo of the elderly residents with his tokens of love.





And according to our source, Perry was likewise unimpressed by John's new single, "Still Feel Like Your Man".





Mayer has admitted that the ditty was written for Katy.





"She's horrified that he's pining for her so publicly," our insider adds.





"He's desperate to convince her he's a changed man, but she's told friends she'll get rid of anything he sends her."
