Kim Kardashian, Kanye West Aren't in Couples Therapy: Source

Amid reports of couples therapy for Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, PEOPLE has learned the reality star and the rapper are seeking help — just not together.

“They are still both receiving individual therapy,” a source tells PEOPLE of the couple. “Kim is dealing with the trauma from the robbery. Kanye is receiving help for depression and learning how to cope with stress better.”

“They might be thinking about couples therapy, but so far it seems they haven’t had any sessions together,” the source adds.

The Wests’ marriage has been the topic of conversation since 36-year-old Kim’s October robbery and Kanye’s recent hospitalization for exhaustion, but a source close to the couple revealed to PEOPLE last week that “splitting is not even a point of discussion.”

“Truly no truth behind divorce rumors. It’s not something she would divorce him over,” the source said, adding, “He had a breakdown, but it does not pertain to them not getting along.”

Kim and Kanye have rarely been photographed together since October, though they did step out for a casual dinner for two at the Santa Monica restaurant Giorgio Baldi this past Sunday.

The couple shared pasta, according to the onlooker at the restaurant, and while they “weren’t affectionate,” the duo “were very friendly” and “had good energy.”
