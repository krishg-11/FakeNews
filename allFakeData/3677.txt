Justin Bieber thanks God he is no longer 20-years-old

JUSTIN Bieber is dating Hailee Steinfeld, according to TMZ — but the actress-turned-pop star’s team says they’re just friends.

TMZ reports the couple have dated for just over a month after they were introduced by Hillsong pastor, Carl Lentz. The singers both attend his church.

Bieber himself tweeted in 2011 that he met Steinfeld at the Golden Globes the same year she was nominated for an Oscar for her role in True Grit.

According to the gossip site, Bieber, 23, met up with Steinfeld, 20, in New York yesterday after she attended the Met Gala.

However a source told The New York Post the actress is not game for a romantic relationship with Bieber and has made it clear to him she’s “not interested in anything but a friendship”.

Similarly, a source told Us Weekly the pair’s relationship is not romantic, and that Steinfeld is still dating 20-year-old Cameron Smoller.

The couple went public with their relationship in December, with Steinfeld sharing an Instagram photo of herself cosying up to Smoller in front of the sunset.

A month later, they attended a W magazine event at Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles ahead of the 2017 Golden Globe Awards.

Bieber famously dated Selena Gomez on and off from 2011 to 2014.

He has since been linked to Lionel Richie’s teenage daughter, Sofia Richie, reality TV star Kourtney Kardashian, and model Hailey Baldwin.
