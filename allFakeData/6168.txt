Katy Perry Dating Robert Pattinson

However, you can see there are other people at the table, so it may just be a friendly meal (lol since when were they even friends?!)

What has people even more concerned is the fact that it was only last month that Robert made that weird claim about his relationship with FKA twigs. When interviewed by Howard Stern, he was asked if they were engaged, in which R.Patz replied, "Yeah, kind of."

UM, how can you be kind of engaged? It seemed to make fans believe that there was ~trouble in paradise~.

So, who freakin' knows?!
