Ivanka Trump Sat in for Dad at G20 Meeting and Twitter Is Not Having It

Ivanka Trump sat in place of her father at a G-20 Summit meeting with world leaders on Saturday, and social media is unloading on her for it.

Donald Trump's daughter is being slammed for taking her dad's place in the meeting. Ivanka, who has a White House job as her one of her father's key advisors, was apparently told to take his place in the meeting while he briefly exited the room.

A Russian official tweeted (and then deleted) a photograph of Ivanka Trump sitting in between British Prime Minister Theresa May and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The move was heavily criticized, as a BBC correspondent noted that when a President isn't available to take his seat in meeting for whatever reason, it is usually filled by a high-ranking member of his office.

Here's a sample of the reaction from enraged social media users:

Had Michelle Obama (more qualified than Ivanka) filled Barack's seat at the G-20, the media and the GOP would be calling for impeachment. â€” Terrell J. Starr (@Russian_Starr) July 8, 2017

Ivanka last week: "I try to stay out of politics."

Trump decided it was take your child to work day but he forgot to go himself. Ivanka Trump went to the G20 instead of her dad â€” Will Black (@WillBlackWriter) July 8, 2017

She is no more competent than her father. America should be ashamed we are sending incompetent nobodies to international summits. â€” Laurie Payne (@ljpne) July 8, 2017

This pic of Ivanka seated next to the Pres China and PM of UK is disturbing. What's also disturbing: we have the pic because of the Russians pic.twitter.com/XDvhXrQprr â€” Yashar Ali (@yashar) July 8, 2017

Ivanka Trump has NO PLACE at G20! ABSURD. An INSULT to the world leaders who belong there. Did other leaders bring their kids??? â€” chris collins (@ccollins43) July 8, 2017

Ivanka Trump sitting at the G-20 table in place of her father should scare everyone. Last I checked she wasn't on the ballot in any state. â€” Jacob Gil (@jacob4kids) July 8, 2017

Having Princess Ivanka represent US at G20 table a slap in face to other G20 leaders, other top admin officials, American people. Grotesque. â€” David Rothkopf (@djrothkopf) July 8, 2017

No one voted for Ivanka, nor was she confirmed by Congress, yet she was sitting in for trump in the G20 meeting. Shameful, embarrassing. â€” Political (@trump_scamalert) July 8, 2017

Big fan of seeing the words, "Trump's been replaced." Lesser fan of seeing the words, "Trump's been replaced by daughter/wife, Ivanka." #G20 â€” Power VO (@PowerVoiceOver) July 8, 2017

Why the hell is Ivanka Trump sitting in for daddy at G20 meetings?! What are her qualifications? Who voted for her? â€” Charles M. Blow (@CharlesMBlow) July 8, 2017

In what world does Ivanka Trump believe she has the experience and skills to attend G20 meetings with world leaders? Hubris beyond belief. â€” Danny Cohen (@DannyCohen) July 8, 2017

Ivanka Trump, unelected, unconfirmed, = no accountability to anyone but daddy. If that's not an indicator of a kleptocracy Iwhat is? â€” Legacy (@Center_Main) July 8, 2017
