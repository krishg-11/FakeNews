Justin Bieber has had enough!

The singer has gone public with his hatred for HollywoodLife.com, claiming that their reports are “untruthful and hurtful.”

Bieber’s first posting of the image has garnered over 700,000 likes since he shared it early Wednesday morning. The star as since posted the image once more in the hopes of rallying even more Beliebers behind his cause.

The Instagram takedown comes after the gossip site reported that, “Gigi Hadid Warns Nicola Peltz About Justin Bieber: He’s A ‘Heart-Breaker’ Who’ll Hurt You,” which has since been taken down.
