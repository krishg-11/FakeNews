Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost Make Their Public Debut as a Couple After 6 Months of Dating

Things are heating up between Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost! On Thursday night, the duo finally made their first public appearance as a couple at the 2017 American Museum of Natural History Gala in NYC after six months of dating. While Colin and Scarlett hit the red carpet separately, the couple later met up inside, where they were joined by Colin's Saturday Night Live costars Michael Che, Aidy Bryant, and Leslie Jones. Aidy even shared a snap of Colin presenting at the gala on her Instagram story, writing, "When you a hunk and you know it," likely referencing Colin's recent honor of being named 2017's Sexiest Joke Writer by People.

Colin and Scarlett have been keeping their relationship under the radar since they first got together in May, but earlier this month, they were spotted getting hot and heavy in the wee hours of the morning on a street in NYC. Now that the pair has finally made their public debut, hopefully they'll make their first joint red carpet appearance soon.
