Let These Adorable Celeb Couples Restore Your Faith In Love Today

We need to stay strong in the face of this pop culture travesty and reflect on the blessings that still surround us. We're not talking about blessings like Pumpkin Spice Lattes, Stranger Things and Cheeto's Chicken Fries, either. We mean those famous relationships that have managed to stay strong in a world where every nanny is more threatening than a listeria-filled Eggo. Today the world needs the John Legend's and Chrissy Teigen's to remind us what true love looks like. When you go home tonight, whether it be your mom, boyfriend, wife, cat or vibrator, make sure to tell them how much they really mean to you. In the meantime, if you're having trouble recovering from the Jolie-Pitt split, pick yourself off the ground, scroll through this list, and remember that whatever happens, love is NOT dead.
