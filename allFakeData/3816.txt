Hollywood Stars Slam House Vote for Obamacare Replacement

Katy Perry, Alyssa Milano, Sarah Hyland and Rob Delaney attacked the bill, designed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, for its approach to pre-existing conditions and funding for Planned Parenthood.

Shortly after the House of Representatives voted on a health care bill designed to repeal and replace Obamacare, numerous Hollywood stars took to Twitter to condemn those politicians who supported the bill.

The Republican-backed measure won by a narrow 217-213 vote, with Democrats singing "Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye" as the bill passed the legislative chamber, suggesting that the GOP's support for the bill would cost them in the 2018 midterm election.

"I feel so confident," said President Trump during a live address after the passing of the bill. "This is a repeal and replace of Obamacare. Make no mistake about it."

The bill, which now heads to the Senate, where it faces an uncertain fate, will keep children on family policies until age 26 but will cut the Medicaid program for low-income people and end tax penalties in the Affordable Care Act on the health industry and those who earn high-paying salaries.

The bill will also block federal payments to Planned Parenthood for a year and allows states to get waivers to free insurers from coverage requirements, which could cause them to charge people with pre-existing illnesses higher rates than they charge healthy customers.

In a viral video, Jimmy Kimmel expressed his views on equal healthcare for those with pre-existing conditions such as his newborn son. "If your baby is going to die, and it doesn't have to, it should not matter how much money you make," he said while tearing up during his monologue on his show Monday night.

The hashtag #IAmAPreexistingCondition became a trending topic quickly after the bill was passed. America Ferrera, Sarah Hyland, Mark Ruffalo and George Takei took to Twitter to express their views.

The revisions to the #AHCA consider domestic violence and sexual assault to be pre-existing conditions. As a victim I'm appalled. #VoteNo — Sarah Hyland (@Sarah_Hyland) May 4, 2017
