Should Alex Rodriguez pop the question to Jennifer Lopez, the former Yankees slugger ensured “Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon that he’ll be the first to know.

After the “El Anillo” (“The Ring”) singer joked Wednesday to Fallon, 43, about how there’s “no pressure” for her boyfriend of a year to propose, Rodriguez, 42, revealed Thursday he had to be clued in about the song’s true meaning.

“I’m reading the piece of paper like this and it’s the song,” Rodriguez said of his late-night trip to Lopez’s recording studio. “I know nothing about music. I read the song and I go, ‘Babe, it sounds like they’re talking about us.’ And she goes, ‘Yeah. They made it for me.’ I heard it for the first time and I knew it was going to be a smash the first time I heard it.”

Lopez, 48, previously said “El Anillo” is about women ready for the rock.

“The song is definitely about that, it is, but I felt like it was kind of something that all women get to a point where they say, ‘OK, what’s up?'” the thrice-married star explained. “Like we’re good, everything’s great, what’s going on? Am I staying or am I [going]?”

Lopez and Rodriguez appear to be going full-speed ahead, ending their New York tour with a pit stop in the Bronx for Thursday night’s Yankees game.

The Bombers fell to the Boston Red Sox 5-4, ending their eight-game hot streak.
