Other members of Trump’s party, like Marco Rubio, John McCain and Lindsey Graham, who have been willing to criticize the new president on some of his actions, also tweeted positive reviews of Gorsuch.

As to be expected, conservative pundits like Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter weighed in in support of the nominee.

I look at that lovely couple, Judge Gorsuch & his wife, and think about how they are about to be viciously slandered by the left. — Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) February 1, 2017

Judge Gorsuch is good for America. A traditional jurist who respects freedom & understands intent of Constitution. Big win for Trump -BO'R — Bill O'Reilly (@BillOReilly) February 1, 2017

Meanwhile, many Democrats voiced their opposition with senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren among those who expressed outrage on social media.

Judge Gorsuch must explain his hostility to women's rights, support of corporations over workers and opposition to campaign finance reform. — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) February 1, 2017

Based on the long and well-established record of Judge Neil Gorsuch, I will oppose his nomination. https://t.co/iYbOWwwGoS — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 1, 2017

Gorsuch put corps over workers, been hostile toward women’s rights & been an ideolog. Skeptical that he can be a strong, independent Justice — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) February 1, 2017

And celebrities, such as Billy Eichner and Chelsea Handler, also took to Twitter following Trump’s announcement.

Gorsuch is extremely anti-LGBTQ and this is a #StolenSeat that belonged to Merrick Garland. — billy eichner (@billyeichner) February 1, 2017

Trump has selected Judge Neil Gorsuch for his Supreme Court nominee. He celebrated by eating Merrick Garland’s heart. — Stephen Colbert (@StephenAtHome) February 1, 2017

Like all arch conservatives, I assume Gorsuch will be celebrating tonight on Grindr. — Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) February 1, 2017

The Sierra Club, the nation’s largest and most influential grassroots environmental organization, created a petition to oppose Gorsuch, claiming that he “would put both our environment and basic rights in danger.”
