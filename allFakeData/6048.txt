Is Liam Hemsworth Mad At Miley Cyrus For Texting Nick Jonas?

Liam Hemsworth is NOT “livid” about Miley Cyrus and Nick Jonas texting one another, despite a new report. Gossip Cop can debunk this claim. We’re told it’s “false.”

According to Life & Style, Jonas has been regularly texting Cyrus, and “it isn’t sitting well” with Hemsworth. A so-called “source” tells the outlet, “[Nick] has been sending Miley friendly texts for weeks, and Liam is furious. He told Miley she better tell Nick to back off.” The magazine’s questionable insider further contends, “[Nick] recently decided he really wants to find a girlfriend and settle down,” adding, “He is reaching out to old flames and old friends, and it doesn’t seem to matter whether or not they’re taken.”
