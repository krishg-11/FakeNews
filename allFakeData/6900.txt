Matt Bomer Proud of Wentworth Miller

Add Matt Bomer to the growing list of Wentworth Miller's celeb supporters.

The White Collar star echoed the sentiments of many Hollywood A-listers in praising the Prison Break actor for recently coming out as a gay man, telling E! News at New York's Heineken U.S. Open kickoff party at PH-D at Dream Downtown tonight, "Wow, I think its really bold and incredibly classy how he came out and did it. I am really proud of him. Its very reflective of his amazing character."

Additionally, Bomer—who came out in February 2012—acknowledged the positive legal changes happening for the LGBT community in the U.S. by saying, "I hope all these laws continue to pass but we still have a long way to go."
