Celebrities react to Roger Moore's death

The world lost a super spy this week. Roger Moore, the second actor to play James Bond on the big screen, died Tuesday at the age of 89. Though Moore was neither the most famous nor most acclaimed version of Bond (even he ranked himself fourth), he did play the character the longest, in seven films stretching from 1973 to 1985. As EW’s Chris Nashawaty wrote in a 2008 profile, “Moore played 007 more times than any other actor. By rights of possession, he owns the part.” So perhaps it’s no surprise that Moore’s death has invited a trove of remembrances and tributes from people across the pop culture spectrum.

In addition to spying, Moore was also a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador from 1991 until his death, working for humanitarian causes to help the world’s children. After his death, UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lane issued a statement.

“With the passing of Sir Roger Moore, the world has lost one of its great champions for children – and the entire UNICEF family has lost a great friend,” Lane said in his statement. In his most famous roles as an actor, Sir Roger was the epitome of cool sophistication; but in his work as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, he was a passionate – and highly persuasive – advocate for children. He once said that it was up to all of us to give children a more peaceful future. Together with Lady Kristina, he worked very hard to do so. All of us at UNICEF extend our deepest sympathies to the Moore family, and join his many friends and admirers from around the world in paying tribute to his life and mourning his loss. He will be deeply missed.”
