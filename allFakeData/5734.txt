John Heard dead: Celebrities pay tribute

John Heard, an actor perhaps best known for his roles in Home Alone and on The Sopranos, died Friday at age 72. Shortly after receiving the news of his death, actors and other artists began sharing tributes to the late actor via social media.

Elijah Wood, who appeared with Heard in 1992’s Radio Flyer, tweeted, “Sad to hear of John Heard’s passing.”

“What a wonderful actor,” Jeff Bridges wrote. “We were in the movie Cutter’s Way together & I got to experience his artistry and dedication first hand. My heart goes out to his family and loved ones. We miss & love you, John.”

“I had the pleasure of working with John Heard in #whitechicks,” Marlon Wayans wrote on Instagram. “He was a great guy. Shared a lot of laughs. Sad to see such a good spirit and actor taken. Thank you for all your contributions to our beloved industry. May you live forever through your vast body of work. #ripjohnheard.”

“RIP John Heard,” wrote Michael McKean. “Never not good.”
