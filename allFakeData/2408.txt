Hollywood gender pay gap revealed: Find out who are the highest paid stars

The Hollywood gender pay gap has been laid bare in figures that show highest-paid actress Emma Stone is out-earned by 14 male actors.

Stone earned $26 million (around £20 million) in the year up to June 2017, due in part to the success of the hit musical La La Land.

But she would only rank 15th in an overall table of Hollywood’s - and Bollywood's - biggest earners.
