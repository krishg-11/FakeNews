Kim Kardashian and Kanye West to Divorce: “Paranoia Has Taken Over [Kanye’s] Life” (EXCLUSIVE)

Kim Kardashian has had enough. The mom-of-two, 36, has been talking to divorce lawyer and confidante Laura Wasser as she moves to end her marriage to Kanye West.

Multiple sources tell In Touch exclusively that Kim is “terrified” of her husband’s behavior — and was fearful even before he was checked in to the hospital.

“Before his breakdown, he was hearing voices and taking pills to sleep and to stay awake,” a Kardashian insider notes. Another source adds, “He’ll walk into a room and look for recording devices behind frames and in flower arrangements. He doesn’t trust anyone. Paranoia has taken over his life.”

And while Kim feels the need to do what’s best for her and their children — North, 3, and Saint, 1 — the decision to leave Kanye hasn’t been an easy one.

“She really thought Kanye was her soul mate and is absolutely devastated,” the source says. “But this isn’t what Kim signed up for when she married Kanye. She’s done.”
