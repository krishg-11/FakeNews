Are Drew Barrymore and Will Kopelman Back Together?

It’s that time of year — where love is clearly in the air! And even Drew Barrymore isn’t safe! The Blended star was spotted getting cozy with ex-husband Will Kopelman, leaving the world wondering if they are getting back together? The couple, who split in 2016 after four years of marriage, have been spending nights together, an insider tells In Touch.

“When Drew was filming Santa Clarita Diet, Will would fly into LA from NYC. Even though he had a hotel room, he ended up sleeping at Drew’s house from time to time. Then when she finished shooting in October, it became a more regular thing. They enjoy each other’s company,” revealed the insider.

“They’re both in great places in their lives,” says an insider. Spending so much time together has reminded Drew, 42, and Will, 40 — who share daughters Olive, 5, and Frankie, 3 — of the way things used to be. “It’s like it was at the beginning of their relationship, so relaxed and comfortable,” says the insider, adding that a reconciliation “is a real possibility.”

Drew revealed that she felt like the “biggest failure” after announcing her divorce. “Like, when you get divorced, you break up with somebody and you’re like, ‘Yeah, that didn’t work,’ and you get divorced, [but] when you get divorced you’re like, ‘I’m the biggest failure. This is the biggest failure.’ It’s so shameful and hard to actually go through that, even privately.”

This isn’t the Never Been Kissed star’s first divorce. She was previously married when she was 19 years old to Jeremy Thomas and fellow actor Tom Green in 2001. Both marriages only lasted a year.
