Blake Shelton Inspires Gwen Stefani to Feel Sexy

Gwen Stefani has always been a fashion risk taker. Whether it was dressing as a punky tomboy during her years as the frontwoman for No Doubt or embracing her love for Japanese fashion with Harajuku, Stefani has always found a way to stand out.

Recently, the rocker has been embracing her feminity, wearing things that recall old-school Hollywood glam, and that’s much to do with her relationship with country crooner Blake Shelton. During a conversation with supermodel Heidi Klum for InStyle, Stefani was asked to describe her current style.

“More feminine than ever before,” Stefani shared. “It’s probably because I’m super in love and have a really manly man [Shelton]. I enjoy letting that part of me come out now because when I was in No Doubt, I never thought of myself as sexy. Even in my 30s, I was a tomboy. I hardly ever carried a purse.”

Her affection for the “I Lived It” singer carried over to her answer to the question of “What’s your favorite thing that you’ve ever worn?”

“The red Yanina Couture dress I had on when Blake and I stepped out [together] for the first time,” Stefani explained. “That was a magical night, and I loved the flowers.”

Shelton’s inspiration influenced Stefani’s Las Vegas residency show, Gwen Stefani — Just a Girl, when she sported a cowgirl-inspired ensemble for “Make Me Like You.”

“That part of the show is my super love note, my, ‘I am so grateful, this is how much you influenced me and gave me life,’” she told Extra’s Mark Wright.

The couple continues to support one another through their separate endeavors, as Shelton flies back and forth to Vegas for Stefani’s show while filming season 14 of NBC’s The Voice.
