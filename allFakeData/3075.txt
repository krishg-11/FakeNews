Taylor's Lonely Life

Taylor's Lonely Life

Taylor Swift hasn’t been quite so good at “shaking it off” recently. Once Hollywood’s ultimate social butterfly, the pop star has remained mysteriously out of the spotlight this year — way out. Other than her July court hearing to testify against the DJ who was convicted of groping her, she hasn’t made any public appearances in nearly nine months. Paparazzi have only gotten glimpses of her, bundled in hoodies and dashing into cars with her new boyfriend, British actor Joe Alwyn, 26. She deleted her entire Instagram history in August, before dropping her provocative comeback single “Look What You Made Me Do,” but she still hasn’t come out from underground.
