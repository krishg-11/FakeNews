Is Demi Lovato Upset About Meghan Trainor Performing The 'Smurfs' Movie Song?

Demi Lovato is not upset that Meghan Trainor was asked to perform a song for Smurfs: The Lost Village instead of her, despite a bogus tabloid report. Gossip Cop can exclusively bust this claim. We’re told it’s “absolutely not true.”

Both singers lend their voices to the upcoming animated movie, but only Trainor is featured on the soundtrack. A so-called “source” tells OK! that Lovato is furious about the supposed snub because “she’s sure she could have done better.” The seemingly phony source further purports that Lovato is "offended by Meghan’s presence" and "rolls her eyes" whenever the film’s director "gushes about Meghan’s music."
