Kim Kardashian’s Family ‘Furious’ Over Donald Trump Meeting

Traitor! Kim Kardashian’s Family ‘Furious’ Over Meeting With Donald Trump The ‘KUWTK’ star is being forced to follow hubby Kanye’s ‘strict orders!’

Kim Kardashian’s meeting with President Donald Trump this week to discuss prison reform has caused a ton of drama with her famous family, RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned.

“Kanye is so proud of Kim for meeting with the Trump, who he openly supports. But Kris and her sisters do not agree with her decision and feel that she is being incredibly selfish by ignoring her own true beliefs to follow Kanye’s political agenda,” a Keeping up with the Kardashians source said.

However, it seems that Kardashian’s meeting and subsequent open dialogue with Trump has caused a huge rift between her and her family, who did not attend West’s album listening party last night in Wyoming.

“Kim’s family were all invited and many of them were planning on going before Kim’s meeting with Trump,” the insider said, adding, “The worst part is that Kim has no idea her sisters and furious.”

But even after West’s pro-Trump Twitter tirade last month having caused a rift in their friendship with pals John Legend and Chrissy Teigen, as well as death threats, Kardashian has continued to stand by her man!

“Kim is being obedient to Kanye now and the power shift has changed dramatically,” the source told Radar.

“Kanye is in the driver seat now. ”
