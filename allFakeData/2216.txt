Barack Obama: Michelle Obama wishes she didn't have to be married to me while I'm president

First lady Michelle Obama has made it clear she's eager to leave the White House, step into the next phase of her life, and even enjoy a simple trip to Target.

With less than a week until President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in and moves into the White House President Obama is sitting down with multiple news outlets to discuss his final days and office and legacy, and he revealed to 60 Minutes just how eager his wife is to move on.

"Michelle never fully took to the scrutiny, she's thrived as a first lady, but it's not her preference," the outgoing president explained in his interview with the news program. "She never fully embraced being in the public spotlight, which is ironic given how good she is."

"She used to say, Barack's exactly the kinda guy I want to be president I just wish he didn't want to do it when I was married to him," he added.
