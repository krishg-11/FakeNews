Hurricane Harvey caused terrible wreckage after making landfall in the town of Rockport on Friday night, as a Category 4 storm. Port Aransas and Rockport took the brunt of the storm, which hit the coastal area with 130 mph winds. The storm left homes flooded, many without power and several buildings destroyed.

On Saturday and early Sunday, parts of the Houston area had received more than 20 inches of rain, with southeast Harris County logged at 24.28 inches of rain in 24 hours, the Weather Channel reported.

At least five people had been reported dead on Sunday as a result of Harvey, according to The Chicago Tribune. Officials said they expect the number of fatalities to rise in areas hit hardest with flooding.

As officials, crews and residents scramble in Texas, Bachelor alum Sean Lowe, who is from Arlington, looked to take action.
