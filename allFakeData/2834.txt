Rumor Bust! Danny Fujikawa Did Not Dump Pregnant GF Kate Hudson

Kate Hudson and Danny Fujikawa are doing just fine as they await the arrival of their baby girl, despite a report.

A wild new story claims Kate was rushed to an emergency room with complications, adding that amid the health scare… Danny dumped her.

A post shared by Kate Hudson (@katehudson) on Jun 23, 2018 at 12:40pm PDT

Gossip Cop, however, reports the story is bogus, pointing to their social media accounts as proof.

In fact, Instagram photos show Kate and Danny have been traveling together all summer. That certainly wouldn’t be the case if Hudson were having complications.

Plus, her posts seem to be all about summer fun, without signs of trouble.
