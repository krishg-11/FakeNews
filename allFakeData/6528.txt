Lin-Manuel Miranda Talks 'Almost Like Praying' Song, Puerto Rico And Trump

To promote the cause, Miranda stopped by the morning talk shows. On “GMA,” Miranda explained the song, which samples “Maria” from West Side Story, was inspired by the 78 cities of Puerto Rico, which were cut off from communication following the storm. Of getting fellow celebrities on board, “You burn up your Rolodex and tweet the people whose numbers you don’t know, and really, every artist made miracles happen” to take part, he said. As for the title, “Almost Like Praying,” Miranda said, “Thoughts and prayers are great, but thoughts and prayers are not enough. We need more. We need action. We need the government’s response to be equal of that of the people.”

“If the government can step up to where our people are, we can be on the road to recovery a lot faster,” Miranda said. Asked about tweeting that Trump is going “straight to hell” after he ripped Puerto Ricans and the mayor of San Juan on Twitter, the composer said, “I’ve never seen a sitting president attack the victims of a natural disaster before.” He repeated that on the “Today” show, and further said, “Those were the only words I had to express my feelings on that… That was not an impulsive tweet. Those were the only words I had left and I’m a guy who puts words together for a living.”

In addition to “GMA” and “Today, Miranda was on “CBS This Morning” and “Despierta America.” He also appeared on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” on Thursday night for the announcement that Colbert and Nick Kroll’s viral #PuberMe campaign raised $1 million. Check out the videos below.
