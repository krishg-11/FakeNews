AceShowbiz - %cSelena Gomez% is reportedly worrying about unavoidable run-in with her ex-boyfriend %cJustin Bieber% at the upcoming 2017 Billboard Music Awards. The "Hands to Myself" hitmaker doesn't want to meet Justin while she's with her new beau %cThe Weeknd%.

"Selena's happier than ever," a source tells Life & Style, "But she doesn't want to rub it in Justin's face. She's afraid of being herself around Abel if Justin is nearby because she doesn't want to hurt her ex."

Selena is nominated for Top Social Artist alongside Justin, who will also compete against The Weeknd in the Top Male Artist category. The 2017 Billboard Music Awards will take place at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas on May 21.

While Selena and The Weeknd have been supporting each other, her mom is reportedly not a fan of the "Starboy" hitmaker dating her daughter, who just completed a stint in rehab late last year.

"Mandy has met Abel and thinks he is respectful in person, but she doesn't think he's a good influence on Selena," another source revealed, before adding that Selena's mom didn't approve of his "dirty and drug-related lyrics."
