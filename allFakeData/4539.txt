Caitlyn Jenner wants a baby with Kim Kardashian's surrogate

A bizarre report from top selling US publication Star claims the former Olympian is using sperm she froze during her marriage to Kris Jenner, and getting the woman Kim paid to carry newborn daughter, Chicago, to carry the baby for her.



“Caitlyn thinks she was a bad father because she wasn’t living as a woman, her true self,” a close pal tells the magazine.



“She loves the idea of raising a child as the mother she has always longed to be. Now she thinks she’s be a totally different parent.”



However, the Kardashian-Jenner clan are said to be horrified that 68-year-old Cait is considering giving motherhood a go – especially Kim.



“Kim was furious when Caitlyn reached out to her surrogate,” continues Star's insider.



“It’s not like there aren’t any other surrogates in the world. Kim is convinced that this is just a way of pushing her buttons, and clearly Caitlyn is just as petty as ever.”



In the mean time, Caitlyn at least has her new granddaughter to keep her occupied.



Following the news earlier this week that Kylie Jenner, 20 had given birth to a baby girl, Caitlyn congratulated her daughter with a sweet post on Instagram.



“My daughter just had a daughter. It’s amazing to be by your side through this journey. She’s SO beautiful already. Can’t wait to watch her grow. Throwback to my baby, as a baby @kyliejenner,” she wrote.

Caitlyn has yet to respond to Star's report.
