Burt Ward and other celebrities pay tribute to Batman star Adam West

Soon after news broke that Adam West — who played Batman in the ’60s television series — died at age 88, celebrities began paying tribute to the late actor on social media.

“We met once in 1987 and I was too embarrassed and too foolishly ‘cool’ to tell you what you meant to my childhood,” writer Neil Gaiman said on Twitter. “Farewell Adam West,” director Edgar Wright wrote. “You were MY Batman. Such a super funny, cool, charismatic actor. Loved the show as a kid, still love the show now. POW!”

Burt Ward, who played Robin to West’s Batman on the TV show and remained close friends with the actor for years after, told Variety he is “devastated” by the loss of one of his “very dearest friends.” “Adam and I had a special friendship for more than 50 years,” he said. “We shared some of the most fun times of our lives together. Our families have deep love and respect for each other. This is a terribly unexpected loss of my lifelong friend. I will forever miss him. There are several fine actors who have portrayed Batman in films. In my eyes, there was only one real Batman that is and always will be Adam West. He was truly the Bright Night.”

Read on to see tributes from other stars like Conan O’Brien, Seth MacFarlane, Kumail Nanjiani, American Gods showrunner Bryan Fuller, Jamie Lee Curtis, Elijah Wood, and more.
