Kim Kardashian Trolling Her Own Bikini Pic on Instagram Is Everything

Kim Kardashian is back to doing what she does best: posting photos of herself on Instagram in relatively little-to-no clothing, and giving no effs about it. Because why should she? Every body is a bikini body, and Kim looks incredible in hers, dammit!

Fun fact: Queer Eye's Jonathan Van Ness used a similar caption on a post yesterday, which was shared right around the same time as Kim's. Great minds think alike, Kim and JVN are the best and most self-aware celebs on your Insta feed, etc!
