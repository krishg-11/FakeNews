The untold truth of Kendall Jenner

If you haven't heard of the Kardashian family by now, please stop everything you're doing and reevaluate your life. The Kardashian-Jenners pretty much dominate the entertainment news cycle. And while Kim (and more recently, Kylie) breaking the internet is an almost daily occurrence, one member of the family is quietly slaying the fashion industry. Kendall Jenner, the daughter of Kris Kardashian and Caitlyn Jenner, made her first major runway appearance for Marc Jacobs in 2014.

Since then, she's strutted for major fashion houses like Victoria's Secret, appeared on the cover of Vogue and in commercials for Estee Lauder. Read on to find out more about the powerhouse model.
