Chris Pratt Says 'Divorce Sucks' In First Interview About Anna Faris Split

We’re still not over Chris Pratt and Anna Faris’ split, and it sounds like the “Jurassic World” star isn’t, either.

The actor is finally opening up about his divorce for the first time, nine months after the former couple announced they were separating after eight years of marriage.

“Divorce sucks,” Pratt told Entertainment Weekly as part of the magazine’s summer movie preview “But at the end of the day, we’ve got a great kid who’s got two parents who love him very much. And we’re finding a way to navigate this while still remaining friends and still being kind to one another. It’s not ideal, but yeah, I think both of us are actually probably doing better.”

Pratt and Faris share a child together ― 5-year-old son Jack. Both are seeking joint custody and have reserved the right to obtain spousal support, according to Pratt’s filing, obtained by TMZ.
