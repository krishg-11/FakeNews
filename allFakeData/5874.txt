DIDDY CREEPING??? Caught On A DATE . . . With A WHITE WOMAN!!!

Sean John Combs, also known by his stage names Puff Daddy, Puffy, P. Diddy, Diddy, Love and Brother Love, was spotted out on a lunch date - with a Blonde lady.

The two companions enjoyed lunch at a discreet restaurant in Beverly Hills. The pair enjoyed wine and food during a sunny day out during the mid-week. At one point, the two toasted, and then drank from their shared bottle of White wine.

It's not clear WHAT the relationship is between Diddy and the Blonde lady.

Diddy also recently said that he wasn't interested in owning a NFL team anymore. Here's what Billboard reported:

Sean "Diddy" Combs was in the running for ownership of the the Panthers, but the NFL team ultimately went to the winning bidder David Tepper for about $2.2. billion back in May. When asked if he would try to invest in a different team, Diddy said no.



In an interview with BigBoyTV on Thursday (June 8), the rapper explained his disagreement with the NFL's new policy that would fine players if they choose not to stand during the national anthem this season. Athletes also have the option of staying in the locker room.
