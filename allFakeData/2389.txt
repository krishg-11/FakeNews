"Christian is already fair-skinned, but he's been avoiding the California sun to get that unnatural skin tone like Dracula's," the magazine quoted a source as saying.

"This is a guy who will do anything to make the character look real to his audience and to himself. Everyone's praying he doesn't start drinking blood like a real vampire," the source said, adding, "But no one would be surprised if he did take a swig of the stuff to make the scenes look real."

However, Bale is not a part of the Dracula reboot movie neither he is planning to "avoid sun" for any of his Vampire related movies, Gossip Cop reported.

Meanwhile, on the work front, the actor is currently busy with an upcoming period drama Hostiles.
