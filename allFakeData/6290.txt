Nicole Richie And Cameron Diaz Pose With Their Husbands In Epic Family Photo

Joel Madden took to Instagram yesterday to share a snap of his very famous family all hanging out together, and we are loving their matchy-matchy style. In the photo, the rocker poses alongside his wife Nicole Richie and her dad Lionel Richie, as well as his twin brother Benji Madden and his wife Cameron Diaz. And it seems like they even color-coordinated for the occasion. Each of the celebs opted to wear all-black for the outing except for Nicole, who added a blue blazer and printed scarf to top off her dark outfit.

The only members of their brood missing? Joel and Nicole's two adorable children, 8-year-old Harlow and 7-year-old Sparrow.
