Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick having twins via surrogate

The Sex and the City star and her actor husband are "overjoyed" at the prospect of becoming parents again, according to their publicists.

The couple, who married in 1997, has a six-year-old son, James Wilkie Broderick.

US celebrity news website Entertainment Weekly quoted "a friend" of the couple who said they had been trying to have more children for years but had been unsuccessful.

"They came to the conclusion that this was going to be the best alternative for expanding their family," the friend said.

"They are over the moon as any prospective parents would be. Their life is about to get a lot busier."

The couple reportedly turned to surrogacy last year. They refused to name the woman who will be carrying the twins.

Parker, 44, is currently filming Did You Hear About the Morgans?, a romantic comedy with Hugh Grant. Broderick, 47, is starring on Broadway in the play The Philanthropist.

The Sex and the City sequel is expected to be released in 2010.
