You and Selena Gomez Probably Have One Big Thing in Common

Selena Gomez has taken over Hollywood with music, TV shows, and movies, but don’t be fooled—she’s still just like us. Over the weekend, she shared an Instagram video of her trip to the doctor’s office, and she was straight-up terrified of getting poked with a needle. Like, she really wasn’t having it.

The visit was for a routine check-up, and even though she’s a fan of tattoos, this type of needlework is definitely not her favorite. She might be well on her way to conquering the world, but that doesn’t make her immune to irrational fears, not being able to fall asleep at night included.

At least Sel’s hate of needles and insomnia gets us some hilarious Instagram videos though, right? This is basically us every single time we have a little too much sugar before bed. No more fro-yo past 9pm, guys.
