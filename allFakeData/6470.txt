AceShowbiz - It looks like %cSelena Gomez% could not tolerate it if %cThe Weeknd% still keeps in touch with his ex %cBella Hadid%. According to a Life & Style report, the "Hands to Myself" singer has even threatened to dump her new beau upon catching him texting the Victoria's Secret model.

The tabloid claims that the former Disney darling and the "Starboy" singer, whose real name is Abel Tesfaye, have got into a huge fight because he still texts his model ex-girlfriend. A source reveals that "Selena was so angry, she threatened to end the relationship unless Abel cuts off all contact with Bella."

"Abel and Bella only speak occasionally," explains the alleged source, before adding, "But he's a very independent guy, and he won't be told what to do by Selena." The source further claims, "He finds her neediness a major turnoff."

The insider goes on alleging that it's no wonder if the "Kill Em with Kindness" hitmaker would feel intimidated by the 20-year-old model. Citing the insider, the tabloid says, "People close to Bella wouldn't be surprised if she got back together with Abel one day."

Reps for both Selena and The Weeknd have yet to respond to the report. While it's unclear if the new couple did get involved in the said quarrel, they were recently rumored to be in the "honeymoon phase." Fans wondered if he would pop the question soon, but a source revealed that it's "not going to happen anytime soon."
