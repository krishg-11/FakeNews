Blake Who? Shelton Pushed Aside By Rabid Meghan Markle Fanatics! Teens didn't care about the country superstar 'at all.'

Blake Shelton may be a huge country star, but he’s not nearly as popular as future princess Meghan Markle!

RadarOnline.com has learned Shelton, 41, recently was schlepping groceries at Gelson’s Market in Sherman Oaks, Calif., when a stampede of shrieking teenage girls came running toward him and his cart.

But the screeching gaggle skidded right past the musician without so much as a single selfie!

“The girls weren’t screaming for Blake — they were die-hard fans of Meghan Markle!” laughs an eyewitness, who points out that the supermarket is home to Humphrey Yogart, the fro-yo shop where Markle, 36, worked as a teen.

“They were determined to see where the American princess once blended soft serve for tips,” said the onlooker. “The teens didn’t care about Blake at all!”
