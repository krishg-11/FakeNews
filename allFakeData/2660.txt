Miley Cyrus Asks Her Dad to Be ‘The Voice’ Advisor

One Cyrus is not enough for NBC's The Voice. Pop superstar Miley Cyrus has invited her father, country artist Billy Ray Cyrus, to be her team advisor for the upcoming Season 13.

Miley revealed the news via Instagram in a post littered with #TeamMiley and #TeamDad hashtags, obviously proud to bring the family flag bearer into the mix. Billy Ray, best known for his '90s country smash "Achy Breaky Heart," released a 25th anniversary version of the iconic song in 2017, complete with a new Spanish version, Spanglish dance version and Bootsy Collins EDM version. He also still stars in CMT's original series "Still the King."

The Most Successful Country Singers From The Voice

Cyrus will be joined once again by fellow judges Adam Levine and Blake Shelton, while Jennifer Hudson will be making her first appearance on the American version of The Voice.

Opposite Billy Ray, Levine's advisor will be Joe Jonas, Shelton has Rascal Flatts, and Hudson will team with Kelly Rowland. Advisors for Season 12 included country star Luke Bryan, DJ Khaled, Celine Dion and John Legend.

The Voice Season 13 starts Sept. 25. Shelton has been on every season of the reality singing competition since its inception.
