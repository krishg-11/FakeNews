Cindy Crawford Shows How a Supermodel Swims With 'Morning Dip' GIF

Cindy Crawford shared a GIF with her Instagram followers that looks like a scene right out of Fast Times at Ridgemont High.

On Friday, the 51-year-old supermodel posted a video of herself coming out of the pool in a teeny blue bikini by Melissa Odabash. "Morning dip," she captioned the playful GIF.

Crawford and her husband, Rande Gerber, are clearly good at vacation. While the mother of two was sharing pool pics, the 55-year-old Casamigos mogul posted a photo of the beautiful view. "Mornings like this with coffee and croissants," he wrote.

Gerber also appears to be quite good with a mango ...or is it a football?

While Crawford's vacation pics are pretty flawless, she told New Beauty that she's seen a change in her looks over the years.

"I don't need everyone on Instagram pointing out that I don't look the same way I did when I was 20. I know that," she said. "No matter what I do, I'm not going to look 20 or 30. I just want to look great for 50. I exercise, eat healthy and take really good care of my skin."

Here's further proof that Crawford and Gerber know how to relax right:
