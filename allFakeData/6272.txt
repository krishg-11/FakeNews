Bye, Brad! Angelina Jolie Throws A Divorce Party Post-Pitt

Angelina Jolie is not shedding a tear over her divorce with Brad Pitt — instead she’s throwing a party!

“Angie doesn’t want to call it a divorce party, so instead she calls it her ‘manumission,’” an insider exclusively revealed to RadarOnline.com. The dictionary defines “manumission” as “the act of freeing.” “She’s banning all mention of Brad at it,” the source added.

Jolie has been going through a bitter divorce and messy custody battle with Pitt since they made their split official last year. Now, she’s throwing a celebration in England to commemorate the failed relationship.

“She’s hosting it in London with her new posh circle of pals,” the source dished, “including Baroness and British politician Arminka Helic.”

And Jolie wants the A-list bash to be kept tightly under wraps.

“It will be super discreet,” the insider said. “Angie doesn’t want this to get out when she and Brad are so close to finalizing their divorce.”
