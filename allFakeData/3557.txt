Jay-Z and Beyonce Don’t Like Kim Kardashian – Will It Ruin Her Relationship with Kanye West?

Can Kimye last long-term if Kanye’s besties, Jay-Z and Beyonce, keep giving her the cold shoulder? Or can friends “kill” a love affair?

On last Sunday’s BET awards, it was quite clear that Jay-Z and Beyonce were not buddy, buddy with Kim Kardashian. In fact, the camera caught Jay barely acknowledge Kim when he was going on stage to accept his award with Kanye West. Since Jay and Kanye are not only music collaborators but close friends, will “Kimye” stand a chance?

Unfortunately, Kim cannot make Kanye’s friends like her. It will be Kanye’s responsibility to lay the law down with his buddies. He must let it be known that high school bully behavior toward his girlfriend is unacceptable.

If his friends continue to snub her, then the rap star will have to distance himself from his friends until they realize he and Kim are a package deal.

Although Jay-Z and Beyonce have preconceived notions of what Kim and the Kardashians are all about, they do not actually know who Kim is.

If they take off their judgmental glasses, they may even come to like her or at least tolerate her in their group.

Remember, if a friend is happy with their new significant other, don’t hate. There is a strong chance a friend will be lost.
