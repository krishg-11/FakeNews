Report: Jamie Foxx to Marry Katie Holmes Soon

Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes have managed to keep their relationship pretty quiet for a Hollywood couple. Since the Oscar winner’s ESPN walk-off after being asked about the former Dawson’s Creek actress, the couple have peacefully flown under the radar. Sources are now claiming the singer is ready to turn Katie into Mrs. Foxx, with plans for a wedding reportedly underway.

Sources at OK revealed, “They had some struggles after they decided to go public… It changed the dynamic of their relationship and briefly shook Katie’s identity as a proud single mom who didn’t need a man.”

Speaking of their alleged wedding plans, the unnamed source shared, “There’s talk of a small, intimate ceremony, but of course they want to make sure whatever they do goes off without a hitch.” They also claim that Holmes’ close friend Zac Posen will be designing her wedding gown and daughter, Suri, will be her maid of honor.

“Suri is Katie’s top priority, and she wouldn’t think about getting married unless she was sure it would last,” the insider said. “Jamie has become really close to Suri over the past few years, and she truly sees him as a father figure, so thankfully she was over the moon when her mom told her.”
