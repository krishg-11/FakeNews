Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt might be getting back together

The two have been report­edly meetin­g in secret­

LOS ANGELES,: Actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston are reportedly considering giving their relationship another chance.

Brad and Jennifer have been secretly meeting after George Clooney encouraged Brad to reach out to Jennifer following her split from Justin Theroux.

“They’ve been secretly getting together for late night hook ups and it’s all because of George. George was the first person to call him when his marriage to Angelina Jolie imploded. After Jennifer and Justin announced their split, he encouraged Brad reach out and give their relationship another chance,” a source told Star magazine.

While Jennifer was close to George when she was with the Pitt in late 1990s until early 2005, George was shunted out of Brad’s life by Angelina.

Now that Angelina has left Brad, George took the opportunity to get Brad back together with Jennifer.
