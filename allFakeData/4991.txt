Rumor Bust! Katie Holmes Did NOT Breakup with Jamie Foxx for Joshua Jackson

A wild new story claims that Katie Holmes broke up with Jamie Foxx for her former “Dawson’s Creek” co-star Joshua Jackson, but it simply isn’t true.

The “Dawson’s Creek” stars did reunite recently for an Entertainment Weekly cover, but reports that they rekindled a supposed on-again/off-again romance at the photo shoot... are bogus.

Gossip Cop spoke with reps for Katie and Josh, and confirmed that the story is false.
