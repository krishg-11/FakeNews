Kelly Ripa & Ryan Seacrest Get Last Laugh On Megyn Kelly

Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest are turning cartwheels over crushing Megyn Kelly in the ratings!

“Live with Kelly and Ryan” has more than doubled its lead over the troubled “Today Show” since Megyn took over the 9 o’clock hour in September.

“This is a complete and utter victory for Kelly and Ryan,” a source close to the syndicated talk show told The National ENQUIRER. “They’re celebrating like crazy!”

The triumph was especially sweet for Kelly, since she believed Megyn used a guest-hosting gig on “Live” to help her land the “Today” job.

Insiders say Megyn originally set her sights on taking Kelly and Ryan down. Instead, her ratings have dropped 28 percent from last year!

“The folks at ‘Today’ aren’t thrilled with those numbers,” a source spills. “But Kelly and Ryan certainly are!”
