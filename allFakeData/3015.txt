OJ Simpson called Khloe Kardashian about paternity test

The convict, who served nine years for armed robbery and assault, was close friends with her dad, Robert Kardashian, but is rumoured to have had a secret fling with his wife Kris Jenner during their marriage, something she has always denied.

But according to America’s Star magazine, that didn’t stop The Juice from calling the reality star the minute he walked free from Lovelock Correctional Center in Nevada, and pals claim they had a positive conversation.

“He was on the phone with Khloe the day he got out of jail,” an insider revealed. “He told Khloe that he wasn’t calling to harass her, just to touch base because she and her brother Rob have been on his mind for years.”

O.J allegedly told her the call was one of his main priorities, and although she was stunned, she “heard him out and was polite”, while he suggested meeting face-to-face to discuss a DNA test.

Despite deciding against having one in the past, there has been talk Khloe, and her brother Rob, are considering finally finding out the truth - after rumors her sibling could also be O.J’s biological son.
