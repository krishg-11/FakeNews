Ivanka Trump slammed for ‘fishing’ for royal wedding invite

Every dignitary around the world probably wants to get on the guest list for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding in May 2018 — and social media thinks Ivanka Trump’s included.

On Friday, the first daughter tweeted out a belated congratulations to the couple, who announced their engagement in late November. “Wishing Meghan and Prince Harry a lifetime of love, laughter and happiness together,” she shared. “I have no doubt this couple will do extraordinary things, both individually and collectively. Congratulations!”

Trump’s well wishes were soon the target of online trolls, who accused her of trying to lock in an invite to the couple’s wedding next May at St George’s Chapel in London.

They don’t care what you wish them. They don’t like you and yours any more than we do. #BritsAreSmart — LetsSaveAmerica (@Donnaphoto) December 16, 2017





Aww how sweet but I don’t think y’all are gonna get invited — Mike MacCormick (@DFWsMrFantastic) December 15, 2017





‍♀️Gives pause about why Kremlin Barbie would tweet this other than fishing 4 an invite. Could she seriously not get how much disdain the Royal Family has for #TrumpCrimeFamily? https://t.co/UXPFvfCJiF — Shannon Bearman (@BearmanShannon) December 16, 2017





While Prince Harry famously met Ivanka’s mother-in-law, first lady Melania Trump, in Toronto while hosting the Invictus Games in September, there’s no word on whether he’s met with Ivanka.
