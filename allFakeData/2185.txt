Are Amy Schumer and John Mayer Dating?

According to reports, Amy Schumer and John Mayer are dating. While this might seem like an unlikely coupling, if their Instagram posts are anything to go by, the pair definitely enjoy spending time together

Just a couple of weeks ago, on July 14, Schumer shared this photo taken at Comedy Cellar, with John Mayer standing right behind her:

Prior to that, Schumer was spotted commenting on Mayer's Instagram after he dyed his hair:

According to The Sun, "Amy and John have been friends for years but they have been growing closer over the past few months... It is early days but they have been on a few dates."

Back in April 2017, Daily Mail reported that Schumer had attended one of Mayer's concerts at Madison Square Garden. Perhaps Schumer is just a fan of his music?

To add to the growing evidence, both Schumer and Mayer made ads for Bud Light. Could a collaboration in common have led to 2017's latest rumored celebrity couple? For now, we'll all just have to keep our eyes peeled.
