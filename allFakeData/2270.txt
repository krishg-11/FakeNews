Kim Banned Troubled Kanye From Fashion Week

Kim Kardashian grounded loony-tunes hubby Kanye West from attending New York Fashion Week as scolding punishment for his gonzo behavior!

“She’s using this time to send a message to him — ‘Clean up your act, or it’s OVER!’” a source told The National ENQUIRER.

Kardashian insiders revealed the rapper’s self-destructive drug abuse, mood swings and humiliating public breakdown last November forced Kim to finally lay down the law.

“He knows she’s ready to walk,” said the source, “and he’s doing everything he can to keep her — for now!”

Kanye — who’s rapped about taking Lexapro for anxiety and depression — had also “been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia,” a close friend revealed.
