Drake Is Trying to Get Back Together With Ex Jennifer Lopez





Could Alex Rodriguez’s potential loss be Drake’s gain? The rapper, who was briefly involved with Jennifer Lopez when they collaborated on his album, More Life, in late 2016, regrets that their romance fizzled out. And now that A-Rod cheated on J.Lo, the rapper wants another chance with the star!

“He’s been telling pals that it was his biggest mistake and that she’s ‘the one that got away,’” a source told In Touch. And though he has reached out to tell her so, she isn’t up for a rekindled romance, despite her current heartache. The source added, “She’s just not interested in him anymore.”

The singers were hot and heavy during their short-lived romance but called it quits after the 48-year-old star discovered Drake had been cheating. “Drake was sleeping with [former porn star] Sophie Brussaux behind Jennifer’s back,” a source exclusively told Life & Style. When she learned of the hookup, which allegedly happened on a trip to Amsterdam, “She dropped him.”

Of course Drake, being Drake, hasn’t exactly recovered from the breakup. In one of his latest songs — “Diplomatic Immunity” — he raps, “2010 was when I lost my halo / 2017 I lost a J.Lo / A Rotterdam trip had me on the front page, though I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes / Closed off but I could never stay closed.”

It’s no surprise that the 31-year-old Canadian is trying to reunite with his ex since those close to him revealed that he’s now ready to start a family. “Drake does want to settle down and have kids one day, and he’s confident that the right woman will come along at the right time,” a source told Hollywood Life. “Until then, Drake’s not forcing anything.” Unfortunately for Drake, it looks like J.Lo doesn’t want any cheaters in her life.
