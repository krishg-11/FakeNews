Buzz that Beyoncé will reunite with Destiny’s Child at Coachella has come and gone — but a music insider tells us, “It’s on!”

“Beyoncé and Destiny’s Child are reuniting,” claims the source. “It was teased, rumored, squashed, so nothing much else was said . . . But it’s happening.”

Beyoncé’s scheduled to perform solo on Saturday.

The insider said the added surprise is “to make up for the fact she was unable to perform last year,” when pregnant.

“The girls really wanted it and felt they owed it to the fans.”
