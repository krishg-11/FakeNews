Mar 6, 2017

AceShowbiz - %cKim Kardashian% was reported "considering a cookbook" in mid last year. And now she is allegedly planning to become a "naked chef." As claimed by National Enquirer, the 36-year-old "Keeping Up with the Kardashians" star is currently "doing a nude cookbook."

The wife of %cKanye West% has "found a new way to line her pockets, even when she doesn't have any," claims the news outlet. It goes on alleging that Kim is "pitching publishers on the idea of a cookbook in which she poses nude next to her favorite recipes."

Citing a so-called source, the tabloid says that the mother of North and Saint West has "came across a copy of David Thorpe's book 'Rude Food', among some of her dad's old things," and now she "wants to do a cookbook and pose naked with all the recipes."

Her mom %cKris Jenner%'s cookbook allegedly wasn't well-received, but the publication claims, "Kim feels her concept will succeed." It further alleges Kim is certain her nude cookbook will "inspire her fans to watch their own bottom line and stick to the diet-friendly recipes, even if the pictures are of Kim's generous cupcakes."

However, the report above turns out to be not true. Gossip Cop can confirm that Kim is neither considering a nude cookbook nor having any desire to become a "naked chef." Citing a rep for the stunning socialite, the site reveals the story made by National Enquirer is entirely "false."
