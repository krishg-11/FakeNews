Rumor Bust! Jennifer Garner Is Not Pregnant with Twins

Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck are not expecting twins in the middle of their divorce, despite a report.

This week, a wild story claimed Jen was expecting two bundles of joy with her estranged husband, but Gossip Cop has learned it's not true.

The article went on to say that the pregnancy is what prompted Ben to go to rehab, but again, the story is bogus.
