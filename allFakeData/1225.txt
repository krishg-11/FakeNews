Oscar Pistorius Attempts To Commit Suicide

The former Paralympic athlete reportedly tried to commit suicide.

Convicted murderer Oscar Pistorius was, according to reports, rushed to a local state hospital in the early hours of Saturday after he allegedly attempted on his life.

Although information is still sketchy, a social media report claimed that the former Paralympic athlete had injured his wrists in his prison cell.

He was rushed to a nearby hospital.

According to City Press, correctional services said Pistorius claimed he had injured himself after falling out of bed.

“An inmate situated close to the hospital section told City Press that Pistorius had injured himself intentionally,” the news report stated.

The report added that sharp blades were subsequently found in Pistorius’ cell during a search on Saturday afternoon.

The reports could not yet be confirmed.

Mashego wrote that he had also established from warders that Pistorius had been planning to harm the Kgosi Mampuru II prison’s health manager and a nurse, as they had testified against him, describing him as violent. A raid of his cell weeks ago allegedly found “toxic pills” inside it, though these are likely to be prescription drugs and anti-depressants, which might also be used in a suicide attempt.

The Pistorius family told the Sunday paper that they were not aware of any investigation into Pistorius’ alleged plot against the prison staff. They dismissed it as yet another sensationalist story like many others.
