Selena Gomez Ignores Questions About Justin Bieber's Engagement

Here's the reality ... Selena Gomez will be asked A LOT about Justin Bieber's engagement to Hailey Baldwin, but she's all warmed up and ready to respond ... with a cold shoulder.

Photogs caught Bieber's ex Monday evening in NYC, and a pap asked if she had any comment on his weekend proposal to Hailey. That, or well-wishes ... either way.

More reality ... everyone, especially Beliebers, will judge a lot based on Selena's words -- or even just her facial reactions. So, go ahead and judge away.

She doesn't have much to say to photogs, but she does look preoccupied by her convo with a pal.
