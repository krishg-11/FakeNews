"Watch Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence be a thing," another said.

Some fans were quick to recall the awkward exchange that Faris and Lawrence shared when embracing at the premiere of Passengers in December 2016.

I fully blame Jennifer Lawrence for the 2010 Miley/Liam breakup and now for the Chris Pratt/Anna faris separation. #SAD — bmac (@brigidfay) August 7, 2017

Though the two hugged in front of photographers, Faris appeared to have a pained expression while Lawrence kept her hands claw-like instead of fully touching her co-star's wife.
