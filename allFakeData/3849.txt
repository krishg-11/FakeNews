This time, the rumors are true.

Singer Zayn Malik and model Gigi Hadid both confirmed via tweet Tuesday that they have broken up after two-plus years, one music video and a Vogue spread together.

"Gigi and I had an incredibly meaningful, loving and fun relationship and I have a huge amount of respect and adoration for Gigi as a woman and a friend," Malik, 25, wrote in his statement. "She has such an incredible soul."

He continued, "I'm grateful to all of our fans for respecting this difficult decision and our privacy at this time. We wish this news could have come from us first."

Twelve minutes later, Hadid, 22, issued her own tweet confirming the split.

"Breakup statements often seem impersonal because there is really no way to put into words what two people experience together over a few years," she wrote, "not only in the relationship but in life in general."

She continued, "I'm forever grateful for the love, time and life lessons that Z and I shared. I want nothing but the best for him and will continue to support him as a friend that I have immense love and respect for. As for the future, whatever's meant to be will always be."

A rep for Malik did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.
