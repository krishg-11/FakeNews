'Zombie' lookalike of Angelina Jolie admits she lied about plastic surgery to amuse herself

Last week, pictures of 19-year-old Sahar Tabar from Iran went viral after it was reported that she underwent a whopping 50 surgeries to look like Angelina Jolie. Sahar, who was looked at as the poster child of plastic surgery gone wrong, has now revealed that the pictures were fake.

According to reports, Sahar told Russian news outlet Sputnik that she used a combination of make-up and Photoshop for the photos, which she doctored to "amuse" herself. The teenager, whose Instagram followers multiplied since the pictures went viral, called it a "form of self-expression".

"Over time I post a photo, I make my face more fun and funny, it is a form of self-expression, a kind of art," Sahar said, adding that her "fans" knew that this was not her real face.

Untampered photos of Sahar have surfaced on the internet, which allegedly show what she actually looks like. They are definitely a far cry from her gaunt appearance that shot her to internet fame.
