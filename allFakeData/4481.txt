Charlie Sheen slams accuser

Charlie Sheen has slammed the woman who filed a lawsuit against him over unprotected sex. The actor called out his accuser and exposed her as a “hooker” who is extorting him after sleeping with many other men, reports TMZ.com.

Sheen is responding to the lawsuit filed anonymously last summer by a woman who says he had unprotected sex with her before revealing he’s HIV positive. In his documents Sheen says that Jane Doe is completely making that up. Sheen admits he showered her with money and gifts during their less than two-month-long relationship, however he adds that she not only extorted from him but also stalked him.
