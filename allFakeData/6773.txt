The marriage between Casey Affleck and Summer Phoenix is officially reaching it’s end.

The 41-year-old Oscar winner (and younger brother of Ben Affleck) and 38-year-old actress Summer (the younger sister of Joaquin and the late River Phoenix) split in 2015.

However it was only on Monday that Summer officially filed for divorce from her husband.

According to E! News, Summer has cited “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for wanting a divorce.

The news comes two years after the couple separated - although they only made their separation public in 2016.

Summer and Casey have two sons together - 13-year-old Indiana and nine-year-old Atticus.

The soon-to-be-ex-husband and wife originally began dating back in 1999 - when Summer was in a relationship with someone else, but her brother Joaquin encouraged Casey to pursue her.

"She was going out with someone else and I said, 'Man, she's cute,' and [Joaquin] said, 'You should see if she'll go out with you… don't worry about that dude,’” Casey told The Daily Beast in 2013.

The pair tied-the-knot in 2006 - and had performed together in the 2000 film Committed and a 2002 stage production of This Is Our Youth.

Since October 2016, Casey has been in a relationship with actress Floriana Lima, 36.
