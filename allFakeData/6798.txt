Chris Pratt on Coffee Date with Mystery Blonde

Chris Pratt looked like a single guy back in the dating saddle as he met up with a woman ... who happens to look a lot like his estranged wife.

The "Jurassic World" star was at an L.A. Coffee Bean Wednesday, and had a friendly embrace with the hot mystery blonde.

It's unclear if this was a romantic hookup, or purely platonic ... but, fact is, a lot of people in Hollywood are anxiously waiting for Chris to get back on the dating scene after last year's split from Anna Faris.

We know Anna's moved on with cinematographer Michael Barrett -- he's even met her parents.
