The special education teacher used to date none other than Smallville alum Michael Rosenbaum, OK! magazine reveals in their recent issue (via The Hollywood Gossip).

Apparently, the two dated before she joined Season 21, with the relationship going long-distance for over a year.

The source also maintains she’s “still hung up” on him, which is why she’s “stalling” in getting more serious with Nick.

“There’s no doubt she still has feelings for [Michael],” the insider states.

So much so, they even report “whispers” she might break up with the Wisconsin hunk to go back with her former beau.

She’s even said to have met up with him last July, prior to being cast on the reality series.

“They’re both on the fun-loving, goofy side, so they got along great,” the source claims.

As interesting as it is that the 29-year-old has a past with a semi-famous actor, it sounds like all this buzz is for nothing.

Gossip Cop debunked the rumor soon after, emphasizing there’s no proof the former couple has any intention of getting back together.

“This is a non-existent love triangle that was manufactured simply because Grimaldi happens to have a relatively famous ex,” the site insists.

That doesn’t mean the newly-engaged pair are out of the woods — there is the issue of the Bachelor spending most of his time practicing for DWTS and not with her.
