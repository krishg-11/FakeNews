Miranda Lambert Refuses To Talk Politics: 'You Can't Win Anyway'

The Dixie Chicks infamously faced a career-changing backlash after Natalie Maines slammed George W. Bush over the Iraq war during a concert in 2003. But in recent years, particularly with the growth of Twitter, it’s become extremely commonplace for artists to weigh in on current events. In fact, in addition to singers like Lady Gaga and Katy Perry actively campaigning for Hillary Clinton, many celebrities use Twitter to rip Donald Trump on a daily basis.

But Lambert has no interest in following suit. In the new article, released on Thursday, the author writes , “When I ask Lambert if she thinks that at this moment in history — with, among other things, this particular president in office — there is an opening for her to make the kind of issue-oriented songs [Loretta] Lynn became known for, Lambert is quick to dismiss the idea.”

She is quoted as saying in response, “I am a 100 percent believer in not ever using the platform that I’ve built for anything other than music, because music to me is an escape from your own reality. I don’t want to go to a show and hear somebody preach about their opinions.” And when pushed, Lambert stood her ground.

“It’s so divided [in politics], you can’t win anyway. And what are you winning?” she asked. “For someone to agree with you, and now you’ve spoken your piece and pissed off many other people, just for one person to go, ‘She’s right’? It doesn’t do any good.” Lambert added, “I’m a country singer. We talk about tears in our beers.”

Lambert’s stance is in-line with that of another female country icon. As Gossip Cop reported in February, Reba McEntire argued on “The View” that entertainers shouldn’t talk politics. Elsewhere in the Billboard story, Lambert also discusses her decision not to do press for her last album, The Weight Of These Wings, to avoid discussing her divorce from Blake Shelton. “I just didn’t need to talk about the record,” she told the magazine.

Lambert continues, “If you want to hear my side of the story or my opinion of what happened, it’s all on there. There’s no mystery anymore — take from it what you will.” She also revealed she co-wrote “Vice” the very day the split went public in 2015. “I walked in with guns blazing,” she shared. “I just knew one thing: I didn’t want a breakup record.”
