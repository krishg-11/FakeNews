Justin Bieber’s Gym Ban Lifted

After a scuffle in an L.A. gym, Justin Bieber was determined to prove that he’s a baller — not a brawler. “Justin was banned from Equinox after getting into a fist fight during a basketball game,” reports a source, but it turns out it wasn’t too late to say sorry

“He apologized, so they let him back but made him pay full membership fees for himself and all eight of his bodyguards — about $25,000 a year,” revealed the tipster, noting that while free-throwing punches could land regular folks in jail, everything is now muy bueno for the “Despacito” singer: “ After a period of good behavior , Justin is back on the comped celebs list with people likeand.”
