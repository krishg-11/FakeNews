Star Wars' Mark Hamill mocks his own death hoax: "Truly a legend in his own mind"

Mark Hamill's pretty sick of fending off rumours about his death.

And he's found a brilliant new way to take the piss out of it all – by mourning himself.

The Star Wars legend, who plays Luke Skywalker in the franchise, responded to a Twitter report of his death by writing his own feelings about it.

He jokingly commented on the report: "MUCH OF NATION MOURNS-RIP @HamillHimself a wonderful-underrated & beloved icon-Truly a legend in his own mind #SoGladIGotToMeetHim #KindaSad".

Fans found Hamill's tweet hilarious, with one writing: "Strike @HamillHimself down and he will become more sarcastic than you can ever imagine."

Another wrote "you win my twitter feed today!", while another said, "How many times a year does the internet kill you? #RIP".

Hamill also retweeted his own tweet regarding another death hoax back in February, in which he wrote: "Don't rush me, already! #StillVeryMuchAmongstTheLivingThankYou".

He followed this up with a link to another false report of his death, writing: "ICYMI: I hate when they delete my #fakeObits! (AND set-ups to my punchlines) #DontFWithAJediMaster".
