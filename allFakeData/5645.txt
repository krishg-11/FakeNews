Kim Kardashian admits her selfie obsession is a bit ridiculous

Kim Kardashian has finally explained her selfie obsession, saying everyone needs to take it a little less seriously.

Covering the new issue of Adweek, Kim says she knows her constant picture-taking is a bit "ridiculous," but it's just her way of remembering all the amazing things in her life. Which is fair enough, really.

"So many people think that taking so many selfies is just ridiculous," she says. "For me, what's so funny is I love taking pictures and posting them on social media for memories.

"I'm kind of letting them know, yes, it is ridiculous, but it's all fun. I can look at a photo on social media and see a picture and know exactly where I was by the outfit I had on or who I was with. I take it more as a fun, emotional scrapbook that I love to look back on."

In fact, Kim says she took her first selfie way back in 1984 when she was just five years old and, just like the rest of us, remembers the days when you had to lug an actual camera around with you.

So, why is she covering Adweek? Well, she's is actually making a pretty massive impact on the tech world. Her Kim Kardashian: Hollywood made $74 million last year and is reportedly set to bring in another $200 million this year. Not bad.

The Kardashians are currently filming the tenth series of Keeping Up With The Kardashians and Kim says there's no big secret to their success - they're just "a normal family".

"We are a family like everyone else's that goes through so many different things and we're always there to support each other. I feel like people get that message."
