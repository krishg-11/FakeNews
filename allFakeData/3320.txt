Major Ultimatum! Jay-Z REFUSES To Allow Solange Knowles Inside Beyonce's Delivery Room

Even though it's been three years since their public brawl, things are still heated between Jay-Z and Solange Knowles. Sources tell RadarOnline.com that the rapper is refusing to allow his sister-in-law inside Beyonce's delivery room when she gives birth to their twin babies later this year. According to an insider, Solange “begged Beyonce to let her be her birth partner.” The pregnant singer was open to the idea of letting her sis witness the birth, but the proud papa is putting his foot down.





“It’s her or me!” Jay told Bey as a coldhearted ultimatum.





The snitch spills, “Jay and Solange still have a tense relationship and he just doesn’t like being in the same room as her."





“He’s told Beyonce these are his babies too and he wants to be there when they’re born, but he doesn’t want Solange ruining his big moment with some mean wisecrack at his expense," the source continues.





And it comes as no surprise that Bey is siding with her man. The insider adds, she's “totally on board with Jay and had to let Solange down gently.”
