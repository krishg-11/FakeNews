Is Drake Referring To Bella Hadid Fling On "Finesse"?

Now that Drake's album is here, everyone is diving into his lyrical content trying to piece together his feelings, coming up with assumptions on who and what the man's really talking about. On his track "Finesse," Drizzy talks about a former gyal that he can't help but think about, saying he wants his baby to have her eyes.

Certain lines talking about Fashion Week and saying it's "more your thing than mine" are leading many to believe he could be referring to his rumoured past fling with Bella Hadid. "I can't even lie, I'd rather stay inside/I can't do suit and tie/Can't be in a room with you and stand on different sides," he sings. "One thing at a time/I have to learn to hide/One thing at a time/Emotions running high/I wish you felt alright."

He adds, "you and your sister/Too hot to handle," that could very well be referring to Bella's older sister, Gigi Hadid. Last October Drake apparently threw Bella a ballin' 21st birthday party. Bella's mom, Yolanda, was pressed about her daughter's relationship with Drake where she played it cool at giving many details. When asked directly if they were a couple, Yolanda said: "What are we… this is like… they’re friends..."
