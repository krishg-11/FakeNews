Why Caitlyn Jenner Decided to Undergo Sex Reassignment Surgery

Caitlyn Jenner has undergone a physical milestone in her transition.

In her new memoir, The Secrets of My Life, the gold medal-winning Olympian–who confirmed her transition from male to female and revealed her new identity as Caitlyn in June 2015–says that she underwent gender reassignment surgery in January 2017, PEOPLE has confirmed.

“The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated,” she writes in the memoir, according to RadarOnline, calling the decision to undergo the surgery “complex.”

Jenner says she decided to be open about the surgery in order to stop the questions and inquiries about when — or if — she would have it done.

“I am telling you because I believe in candor,” she says. “So all of you can stop staring. You want to know, so now you know. Which is why this is the first time, and the last time, I will ever speak of it.”

“I just want to have all the right parts. I am also tired of tucking the damn thing in all the time.”

“Gender confirmation surgery is something I think anybody in my position, or the girls’ position, of course you look into,” Jenner previously said of undergoing the surgery on a 2016 episode of I Am Cait. “For me, I have no idea what the future holds.”

In October 2016, Jenner legally changed her name to Caitlyn Marie and her gender to female.

The Secrets of My Life is available April 25.
