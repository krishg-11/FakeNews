Celebrities Slam Donald Trump Over Mika Brzezinski Facelift Tweet

Celebrities have been taking to Twitter all morning to slam Donald Trump for his tweet about Morning Joe hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough – specifically with regards to his words about Mika.

The President tweeted that once, Mika “was bleeding badly from a face-lift” from his personal Twitter account. Mika responded later in the day with a simple tweet.

“It’s a sad day for America when the president spends his time bullying, lying and spewing petty personal attacks instead of doing his job,” MSNBC, the network that airs Morning Joe, responded in a statement.

Now, celebrities including John Legend, JK Rowling and more have voiced their concerns over the disgusting tweet.
