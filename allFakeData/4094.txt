Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes Find the Best Way to Battle Breakup Rumors

For all the rumors out there that Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes are breaking up, there is alternative information put out by . . . someone who suggests otherwise. A seemingly very well-connected source at Page Six is passing on info that the couple is still in regular communication.

Apparently a “jet-setting source” told Page Six that Holmes and Foxx were FaceTiming on the plane as Holmes and Suri Cruise departed for Paris: “She said she loves him and asked if he wanted ‘cookies from Paris.’ He was in Miami.” Suri’s nanny was reportedly also on the plane.

Foxx has, indeed, been in Miami; he was seen at mega-club E11EVEN on Sunday. The fact that we know this, and that we know Holmes is in Paris with Suri for fashion shows, is kind of monumental. This is a pairing that has managed to stay below the surface since they got together in 2013; though there is a timeline of their relationship, there are big gaps here where no one knows anything.

As Vanity Fair pointed out last year, Holmes and Foxx went to F.B.I.-level lengths to avoid tabloid attention. They reportedly hid out in a luxury resort to celebrate at least Holmes’s 38th birthday, and Holmes “put on a wig and hat” to meet Foxx.

Now, it seems that the high-security walls of this relationship keep tumbling down. People are overhearing FaceTime conversations and spotting Foxx and Holmes out during their nighttime adventures. Perhaps we had fair warning: last year, Us Weekly reported that Holmes was tired of “playing the hiding game.” And what better way to combat breakup rumors than to stop hiding altogether?
