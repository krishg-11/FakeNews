The couple's honeymoon is reportedly taking place in Namibia, in West Africa.

We talked to a travel agent who specializes in luxury travel throughout Africa to find out what Markle and Prince Harry might do during their time in Namibia.

After the royal wedding on May 19, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will jet off for their honeymoon â€” and according to Travel + Leisure, the destination of choice is Namibia, in South West Africa.

Neighboring Botswana, which the couple most recently visited for Markle's 36th birthday celebration, Namibia offers incredible views and ultimate privacy.

To find out what a honeymoon itinerary in Namibia may look like, Business Insider talked to Marisa Lassman, a travel expert and founder of Another Africa, a luxury travel agency that specializes in unique and tailored trips across the continent.

"We go to great lengths to profile our clients and understand their interests, travel preferences, and requirements," Lassman told Business Insider. "No two itineraries are ever the same." Lassman also noted the best time of year to visit Namibia is in May. With the royal couple and their tastes in mind, she drafted an eight-day itinerary for their honeymoon.

From horseback riding, to private tours led by a wildlife documentary filmmaker, to witnessing stunning views of the Skeleton Coast, see how the royals could be spending their time together in Namibia.
