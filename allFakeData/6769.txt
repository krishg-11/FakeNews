Fans Say Footage Shows Miley Cyrus Has A Baby Bump

Amid “reports” Miley Cyrus and Liam have broken up, another rumor has surfaced about the couple.

While the split rumors were making their way around the internet, Miley and Liam were actually spotted together in Nashville recently.

The sighting prompted some fans to believe they saw the slightest hint of a baby bump as Miley walked by at the airport.

What do you think? We watched the video, and for a split second it looked like she did have a baby bump.

Perhaps though, it could just be the angle or her wardrobe deceiving us.

Now, The Mirror just published an article saying that according to sources close to Miley, she has stopped dying her hair, drinking, and smoking.

Could that be an indication she is indeed pregnant?

Well maybe, or maybe she’s just trying to live a healthy lifestyle.

The publication also reached out to Cyrus’s rep for comment. As of this posting, they have yet to respond.

It should be interesting to see how this one plays out.
