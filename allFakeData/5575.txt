Has Jennifer Aniston 'confronted' Selena Gomez over Justin Theroux friendship?

Jennifer Aniston has reportedly “confronted” Selena Gomez after rumours that the singer is growing close to her ex Justin Theroux started circulating.

Aniston and Theroux called time on their marriage earlier this year and rumours have recently swirled regarding his friendship with Gomez, who is good friends with the actress.

New reports by The Sun claim that Aniston phoned the Come & Get It singer to ask some questions about the “bond” after the two were seen hanging out in Los Angeles recently.

A source told the publication: “Jennifer called her to ask why she had been hanging out with Justin, because she felt betrayed.

“She has been close to Selena for a few years and has taken her under her wing. But Jen has clearly been offended, which really affected Selena.”

Standard Online have contacted representatives for Aniston and Gomez for comment.

Speaking in 2015, Aniston said of her friend: “She’s just like a little cherub that I feel like I wanna take care of.”

Gomez, 25, also spoke about her friendship with Aniston, calling the Friends actress “amazing”.

Aniston and Theroux announced their split in February, saying in a statement that their decision “was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year”.

They added that they would continue their “cherished friendship” and that they were “best friends”.
