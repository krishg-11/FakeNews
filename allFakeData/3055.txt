Taylor Swift Has Supposedly Set Up Five-Star Restaurants In Her Homes For Romantic Dinners With BF Joe Alwyn!

Taylor Swift is going all out for her date nights (in) with BF Joe Alwyn!

According to Star Magazine, the 28-year-old singer hired an interior designer to transform her NYC and El Lay apartments into five-star restaurants so she can have romantic dinners with her beau without having to go out into the real world!

An insider who has worked one of the intimate evenings told the mag:

“It looks just like an actual restaurant with Formica tabletops and ambient noise that makes it sound like there are other people there. Taylor has waiters on call in tuxes and menus designed. There’s even an itemized bill presented at the end of the night!”

Sooo… who pays?! LOLz!
