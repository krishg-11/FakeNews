Richard Gere ‘dumps Julia Roberts’

According to US magazine Star, 50-year-old Julia is devastated after months of meetings between herself and Richard, 68, petered out and he’s now consumed with his much younger girlfriend.

Although for years the timing was never right, 'Julia and Richard are undeniably drawn to each other and always have been,' claims a source. So far that has always meant being in the friend zone.

The Hollywood pair are said to have reached out to each other in 2015 when they were both going through a tough time – Julia rumoured to have begun a trial separation with husband Danny Moder late last year.



‘They both were going through a rough time and poured their hearts out to each other,’ continues the insider, who notes that Richard was going through a messy divorce from second wife, actress Carey Lowell.



‘Their heart-to-hearts eventually led to discreet dinner dates in L.A, sometimes in private restaurant dining rooms, where they’d be left uninterrupted and could stay past closing hours.’



However, the American Gigolo star eventually got back together with much younger girlfriend Alejandra Silva, 35 – with the pair even rumoured to have secretly eloped with during a trip to France .



‘Julia spent literally decades loving this man and they have an intense, powerful connection,’ claims the insider to Star of their friendship.



'Of course, she’ll be the first to congratulate Richard, but deep down it’s got to be heartbreaking to see her soul mate commit to someone else.'

Neither party has commented on Star‘s claims.
