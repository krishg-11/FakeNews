Kylie Jenner Made a Contestant Cry on Khloé Kardashian's New Reality Show

Getting revenge on someone who's hurt you can be a very emotional experience — especially when Kylie Jenner is involved.

In a new clip from Khloé Kardashian's upcoming show Revenge Body, a contestant named Stephanie can be seen prepping for her big reveal, where she hopes to demonstrate a newfound sense of confidence to her not-so-nice former BFF. In order to make sure she's as ready as possible, celebrity hairstylist Jen Atkin — a renowned member of the Kardashian glam squad — decides to share a sweet message from Kylie to give Stephanie an extra boost. Pulling out an iPad, Jen then plays a short video where the makeup maven reveals that she's gifted Stephanie with a brand new Kendall + Kylie bikini and a Kylie Cosmetics lip kit, causing the contestant to get very emotional.

"Congratulations on your big reveal," Kylie says in the video. "I hope you love it, and I hope to meet you soon."

You can watch Stephanie's pre-reveal prep and her sweet moment with Kylie below.

Revenge Body With Khloé Kardashian premieres Thursday, Jan. 12, at 8 p.m. on E!
