Blac Chyna and Rob Kardashian have had a rather tumultuous relationship to say the least, most recently breaking up just this March. For Rob, the breakup has reportedly changed his perspective on the whole relationship, so much so that he’s reportedly demanding a second paternity test on daughter Dream Kardashian.

The Kardashian brother reportedly believes his ex could have faked the first paternity test because she often claimed Dream wasn’t his daughter whenever they would argue, according to sources at RadarOnline. “He’s got it in his head that Chyna faked the first paternity test. She’s said to him many times in anger that Dream’s not his baby and even though she always backtracks later, saying she was trying to hurt him."

The source adds, “Rob’s literally been having nightmares about it.” Another family insider believes Rob knows in his heart of hearts that Dream is his daughter, but no longer can trust Blac because of her habit of manipulating his insecurities.
