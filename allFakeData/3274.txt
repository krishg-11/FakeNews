Kendall Jenner has had her third nose job

According to America’s Star magazine, the model and ‘Keeping Up With The Kardashians’ TV star, 21, sought “a subtle sharpening of the tip” in a bid to straighten out what she believed to be a supposedly inferior snout.

An insider told the publication, “People think modeling is a constant stream of compliments for her, but most of the time it’s brutal.

“On castings the clients analyze her from head to toe and point out all her flaws.

“Eventually Kendall got tired of people saying her nose wasn’t slim enough so she went and tried to fix it, again.”

The snitch claimed Kendall was “thrilled with the results,” and that the surgery was inspired by her alleged “idol”, fellow supermodel Christy Turlington.
