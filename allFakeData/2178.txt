Rihanna Has A 'Blowout Fight' With Hassan Jameel Over Her Smoking Weed

It’s no secret that the beauty has a love affair with weed, and is often spotted smoking it and even shares picture of her doing so on social media. Let’s not forget she did dress up as a marijuana plant for Halloween in 2012.

But it’s clearly not for everyone. When dining out with Hassan and some friends in California, Rih Rih chose to smoke around onlookers, and a source told Life & Style that Hassan wasn’t thrilled about it. It didn’t help matters that a staffer passed along a complaint.

“Hassan went nuts,” said the witness. “He asked Rihanna, ‘Why do you always do this? It’s embarrassing.”

And that wasn’t the end of it. The billionaire then “stormed out the door, got in their car and drove off.”

You know something’s wrong when you have the nerve to leave a global superstar without a second thought!

“Rihanna ran after him with her bodyguards chasing her, but when she got there, Hassan had left without her,” said the source.
