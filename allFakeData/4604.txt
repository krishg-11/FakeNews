8 Reasons Why Rihanna & Drake Could Be the Next Beyoncé & Jay Z

7. They're Present on Each Others' Social Media: Although these two lovebirds are notorious for keeping the details of their relationship private, they have graced each others' social media pages. The most recent post was a bittersweet photo telling the story of a fan who passed away after losing a battle to cancer.

"I had the pleasure of meeting an angel on earth! After my show in Miami, @champagnepapi introduced me to Megan! She's inspired me so much with her strength and her perspective on life! So fearless and kind! It's heavy news that I can't slide in your DMs anymore like I used to!! There was always a smile waiting for me there! You brightened any day! Rest up baby girl! We will miss you!!" Rihanna wrote with a picture of the trio.

8. Just Like Jay, Drake Has to Try Hard to Win His Girl's Heart: The back and forth between Drake and Rihanna is no secret, and Drizzy has openly said the Barbados beauty has broken his heart. But he doesn't give up on trying to win her over, and that's a little reminiscent of Bey and Jay's love story, too.

Jay told Vanity Fair a few years back that when he and Beyoncé were both featured on the cover of Vanity Fair's 2001 Music Issue "we were just beginning to try to date each other."

He explained, "Well, you know, you've got to try first. You got to dazzle...wine and dine." The article goes on to state that Hov "'of course' pursued Beyoncé, and when asked if he hadn't been Jay Z—say, he had been a gas-station attendant and she pulled up—would he have been able to date her, he responds, 'If I'm as cool as I am, yes. But she's a charming Southern girl, you know, she's not impressed...But I would have definitely had to be this cool.'"

So, do you agree with the idea that Drake and RiRi could be the next Bey and Jay?
