Jessica Simpson Is Jealous Of Mandy Moore's 'This Is Us' Success

Watch the video for all the details!

Longtime friends Jessica and Mandy aren't so close anymore, an insider revealed to OK!. The former Dukes of Hazard star is envious of Mandy for being on an award-winning show.

"Jessica and Mandy came up around the same time and they were always pitted against each other," the source said. "Now Jessica sees Mandy on billboards all over L.A. and it's like a slap in the face."

"She gripes that she was never taken seriously as an actress," the insider continued, despite the fact that Jessica's husband, former NFL star Eric Johnson, tries to reassure her by telling her "Mandy's success can't compare to hers."

"But Jessica's still got the acting itch," the source said, "and she complains about Mandy to anyone who'll listen!"

"Jessica's always wanted Hollywood credibility," the insider concluded, "and it hurts her to see that Mandy's got it."
