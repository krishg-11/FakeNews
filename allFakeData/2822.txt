Kendall Jenner Tells Friends: Ban Taylor Swift Music Or Else!

An insider says, “There’s no love lost between Taylor and Kendall these days, and what makes it super awkward is the fact they share so many friends.”

Of course, the Kardashians are not trying to be in the same room as Taylor or ever listen to her music, after she dissed Kanye West and Kim in her latest music video, “Look What You Made Me Do.”

At the end of the video, Taylor, clad in leopard, holds up a phone and says she’s “getting receipts” and will “edit them” too, which of course is a reference to her belief that Kim edited audio she released last year claiming Taylor approved of Kanye referring to her as a “b****” and saying he made her famous in his single, "Famous."

The source adds, “Since Taylor’s been in hiding Kendall’s very much the queen bee these days, so what she says goes for the majority of that group. She’s made it clear that anyone listening or supporting Taylor will be banned from her circle instantly, and the likes of Gigi, Bella and Cara are all doing as they’re told.”

But one of their mutual friends is caught in the middle, and it’s none other than Selena Gomez. The beauty “refuses” to distance herself from Taylor, which could spell t-r-o-u-b-l-e. No one wants to get one a Kardashian’s bad side!
