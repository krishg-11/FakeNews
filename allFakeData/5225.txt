The Weeknd Is Jealous Of Selena Gomez’ New Co-Star, British Hottie Jude Law

“Selena is really excited about working with one of her favorite directors and her crush Jude Law. But The Weeknd’s been a real pill about it,” the source told OK!

“She’s annoyed that he doesn’t seem to trust her,” the insider said.

According to the source, The Weeknd has even been keeping tabs on Selena’s phone to see if she’s getting texts from Jude!

“Everything’s been going great in their relationship but this jealousy of his is getting on her nerves,” the insider admitted.

However, The Weeknd might have reason to worry! Jude has been in multiple relationships since his split from his wife Sadie Frost in 2003. In addition to his three kids with Sadie, the actor has two more children from two different women.
