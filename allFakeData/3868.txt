Reasons Gwen and Blake's relationship is totally fake

Stefani did an interview with Ryan Seacrest after the first photos of she and Shelton canoodling on Halloween surfaced. She played coy and wouldn't confirm or deny the romance, instead calling the country crooner "hot." She also alluded to all the gossip about the romance and the leaked photos being part of an elaborate publicity stunt launched by the TV network, saying, "I think that NBC did that. Two divorced people at the same time." Either she was trying to throw the radio host off the scent or she was slyly laying her cards on the table and revealing the truth. Maybe that was a coded message to her ex-husband Gavin Rossdale, who might be reeling from her moving on to a new flame so quick after their split.
