Ellen DeGeneres' wife Portia de Rossi makes her cry with 60th birthday gift

Ellen DeGeneres has all the feels!

On Thursday's episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, the daytime talk show host continues to celebrate her 60th birthday by having wife Portia de Rossi on the program.

Seated next to Ellen, the 45-year-old actress proceeds to bring her wife of nine years to tears upon presenting her with the "best" gift.

"It's your 60th birthday and this gift had to be really special and it had to represent who you are and what you really care about," Portia explains. "Not just now, but what you've always cared about. What you were influenced by and what has made you the amazing person that you are today. So, I combined that and questions when we first met like, 'Who's your idol? And what would you do if you weren't a talk show host?'"

She continues, "So, I combined that with the fact that literally guys, for, like, the last two years, Ellen has said to me, 'I feel like I'm not doing enough.' Every day, almost. So, I put all that together and I got you this gift. So, let's see it -- happy birthday!"

Portia then cuts to a video of her talking about Ellen's hero, Dian Fossey, and her dedication to animals. "So, for your birthday, Ellen, I am bringing you and your hero, Dian, together by building the Ellen DeGeneres Campus of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund," she reveals. "Ellen, you will carry on Dian's legacy by giving them a permanent home in Rwanda. Now, you will join Dian as a protector and champion of these amazing animals, the mountain gorillas. Happy birthday!"

Portia didn't stop there! "I have also set up a foundation in your name called The Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund," she shares. "So, this is the first initiative for the fund that you can take this and do whatever you want with it. You've done amazing work for elephants and you can just continue and support whatever you want to do."

Blown over by the gift, Ellen says tearfully, "It’s the best gift. I’ve always said -- and when we got married, Portia’s line was, 'It’s good to be loved; it’s profound to be understood' -- and, she understands me because that is the best gift that anybody could have given me. So, I love you."
