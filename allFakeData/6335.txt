Brad Pitt Thinks Angelina Jolie Iraq Trip Is Publicity Stunt

War Games? Brad Thinks Angelina’s Iraq Trip A Big Publicity Stunt, Says Source Pitt suspects Jolie’s goodwill work is ‘only to benefit her own ego.’

Angelina Jolie recently headed to the Middle East for the United Nations amid her ongoing custody battle with Brad Pitt, but could she have more than helping refugees on her mind?

“Brad used to admire Angie’s humanitarian work, but is now more suspicious of her true motivations,” a source exclusively told RadarOnline.com. “Brad wasn’t surprised that Angie went to Iraq over the weekend when he was with the kids for Father’s Day.”

As Radar reported, Pitt, 54, recently won more visitation rights with the kids he shares with Jolie — Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and 9-year-old twins Vivienne and Knox.

The exes’ eldest son, Maddox, 16, can decide for himself how much time he spends with his famous dad.

“Angie had already been fuming that details of the temporary custody agreement for the kids this summer had been made public, and according to Brad, she probably hoped the trip to Iraq would deflect negative coverage of her,” said the source.

“For someone to claim to not care about what the press says about her, Angie seems deeply engaged and in the know about what the public perception of her is.”

While the source noted Jolie’s Iraq trip had been planned before the custody deal was leaked, “Brad thinks a lot of her work is only to benefit her own ego.”
