Jamie Foxx walks out of live interview after being asked about Katie Holmes

Jamie Foxx walked away from a live interview during a celebrity basketball game when the presenter asked him about Katie Holmes.

Reports that the pair were dating emerged in 2013, but the couple only went public in September last year. Holmes divorced ex-husband Tom Cruise in June 2012.

Foxx was taking part in the "NBA All-Star Celebrity Game" on 16 February when host Michael Smith brought up photos of Holmes playing basketball on Valentine’s Day, during a live broadcast.

“I know you’ve prepared and I saw pictures,” Smith says in the interview. “Did you and Katie Holmes play basketball for Valentine’s Day? Like some real ‘Love and Basketball’?”

Foxx can be seen smiling as he takes his headphones and mic off and walks away. An assistant unclips the equipment and throws some side-eye at the camera.

“Uh oh, did we lose him?” Smith asks, as the camera shows Foxx warming up on the court. “Oh, he ready to go, he ready to hoop.”

Also taking part in the game were Justin Bieber, Black Panther star Michael B Jordan, Stranger Things actor Caleb McLaughlin, Black-ish stars Anthony Anderson and Miles Brown, and Olympic sprinter Andre de Grasse.
