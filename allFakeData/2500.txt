Khloé Kardashian's Ex James Harden Explains Why Dating Her Sucked

Khloé Kardashian sure likes dating athletes, but not all of them are the right fit for the Kardashian family. As many have learned, dating one of these sisters puts you under a microscope, leaving all your personal drama out for the world to scrutinize.

Just ask Tristan Thompson, Khloé’s current boyfriend. We all know a whole lot about how he’s allegedly neglecting his new kid to hang out with her. I suppose it takes a certain resilience to handle that level of attention. One of Khloé’s exes explained why he decided “thanks but no thanks” to joining the gossip mill.

Sports Illustrated interviewed Houston Rockets baller James Harden for their March 6 issue. Harden and Khloé dated for about 8 months in 2015 but broke it off. In the interview, Harden doesn’t say much about his relationship, but he does explain why living that tabloid life wasn’t for him.

“I didn’t like all the attention,” said Harden, “I feel like it was for no reason. I wasn’t getting anything out of it except my name out there and my face out there, and I don’t need that. It wasn’t uncomfortable, but it wasn’t me. I don’t need pictures of myself when I’m driving my car. Who cares? What shoes am I wearing? Who cares? Where am I eating? Who cares? It was unnecessary stuff that I think trickled down to my teammates. I had to eliminate that.”

Oh my god! He doesn’t care what shoes he’s wearing? This guy is definitely not Mr. Kardashian material. Luckily, he seems to have quite a career going on and hopefully also some less public love in his life.
