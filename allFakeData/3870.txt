Angelina’s kids speak out: We want to live with our dad and Jennifer Aniston

Sources close to Brad reveal that several of his young kids – Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and Knox and Vivienne, both nine – have told him that they want to live with him and new girlfriend Jennifer.

It’s believed that Brad has spent the last few weeks slowly introducing his children to the former Friends star, after they rekindled their romance since her split from estranged husband Justin. And it now seems that Shiloh, Knox and Vivienne, in particular, have become incredibly close to Jen and want to spend as much time with her as possible.
