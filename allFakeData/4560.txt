Kate Middleton’s Twins Won’t Wear Matching Outfits (EXCLUSIVE)

As Life & Style exclusively reported, Kate Middleton is pregnant with twins, but don’t expect the royal — who loves to coordinate her kids’ clothes ��� to dress her babies exactly alike. A palace source reveals the 35-year-old doesn’t want her offspring lumped together.

“[She wants the twins to] be seen as individuals and allowed to develop their own personalities,” the source shares. And, like she did with Prince George, 4, and Princess Charlotte, 2, Kate is keeping the gender(s) under wraps, but those closest to her say she’s having identical girls.

Though fans have been on the lookout for clues based on the brunette beauty’s wardrobe, she’s been all over the map! In her first public appearance since the pregnancy announcement in September, Kate wore a blue Temperley long-sleeved dress, but followed that up a week later with a pale pink Orla Kiely frock.

Kate and husband Prince William are currently in the process of designing duel nurseries for their new additions, who are due in April. “The twins will sleep in separate bedrooms but will share a playroom with George and Charlotte,” the palace source explains. “Kate feels that it’s important for her eldest two to bond with the newborns. She’s obviously worried that George and Charlotte will be jealous of the babies, especially Charlotte, who loves being the center of attention. But Kate knows that sibling rivalry is all part of the process of growing up.”

She’s still suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, or severe morning sickness, but recently gushed about William’s attentiveness. “I’m very lucky. He looks after me as much as possible,” Kate said.

Life & Style previously revealed that despite being fifth and sixth in line for the throne, the twins’ births could affect the rules of succession. They were previously changed in March 2015 to ignore gender bias, so even if Kate does have one girl and one boy, whichever one is born first would be next in line behind Charlotte.
