Courteney Cox, Justin Theroux want you to leave Jennifer Aniston out of the Brangelina split

Jennifer Aniston’s hubby, Justin Theroux, and her bestie, Courteney Cox, have been Team Aniston cheerleaders this week, doing their part to keep their girl out of the Brangelina split narrative.

“I feel like we’re exacerbating it by even talking about it,” Aniston’s forever Friend and former co-star told Entertainment Tonight Tuesday while at the Chateau Marmont for Revlon’s Annual Philanthropic Luncheon. “It’s not about her.” We tend to agree, since Aniston and Brad Pitt divorced 11 years ago. Still, the Aniston jokes came flooding in when news broke that Angelina Jolie had filed for divorce, even though Aniston has been happily married to Theroux since 2015.

Jolie/Pitt divorce: Now what?

The Girl on the Train actor addressed the Brangelina breakup with Business Insider Monday.

“As a child of divorce, all I can say is that's terrible news for those children, and that's all you can really say,” Theroux stated. “It's boring to sort of comment on anything else.”

He also said tabloids making Aniston a part of the saga is just the latest instance of “nonsense.”

“There's an endless appetite for trash, apparently, though everyone would say that they don't have that appetite," The Leftovers star said. "But I think a lot of people do because people buy it. But there are bigger things to (expletive) about. It's shocking how much bandwidth things can take up when there are far more important things going on in the world.”

Valid point, Mr. Theroux.
