Lea Michele Celebrated Her Engagement to Zandy Reich With a Star-Studded Party

Lea Michele got engaged to Zandy Reich, the president of clothing company AYR, in April, and of course, an engagement party was soon to follow. As Page Six reports, the party was this past Saturday, and there was no shortage of celebs at the outdoor bash.

The singer and actress shared a bunch of photos from the party, and in one of the pictures, Lea thanked her close friends JoAnna García Swisher and Stephanie Levinson, who threw the party.

Lea also shared a photo with High School Musical alum Ashley Tisdale, who posted the same photo on her account, with the caption, "Last night was magical. Celebrating my girl @leamichele and Z on their engagement. I couldn’t be happier for this girl, she deserves the best because she is the best. I’m so lucky to have you in my life."

Other attendees included Emma Roberts, Hilary Duff, Billie Lourd, and Jamie Lynn Sigler, People reports.

Lea announced her engagement to Reich with an Instagram photo, which she simply captioned "Yes."

As People reports, the ring is four-carats, and Reich designed it with Leor Yerushalmi and The Jewelers of Las Vegas.

Lea also opened about her engagement during an appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen. "I was so surprised. I kept saying, ‘Stop joking around. Stop joking around. But it was so great," she said.

Aww.
