Chrissy Teigen, Andy Cohen and More Celebs React to Donald Trump's Shocking Mika Brzezinski Tweets

President Donald Trump's tweets are once again causing plenty of controversy.



Trump's tweets about Morning Joe co-hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough on Thursday morning quickly went viral, when he called Brzezinski "crazy," said she has a "low I.Q." and claimed she had a facelift. The tweets came after Scarborough and Brzezinski criticized him on their MSNBC show, Brzezinski saying he had "teensie" hands and that he was "lying every day and destroying the country."

"I heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don't watch anymore)," Trump later tweeted. "Then how come low I.Q. Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe, came to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year's Eve, and insisted on joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no!"

And it appears the feud is here to stay. Brzezinski tweeted a picture of a Cheerios box on Thursday, reading, "Made For Little Hands."

Melania Trump, who has said that cyberbullying will be one of the main focuses of her work as first lady, stood by her husband.

"As the first lady has stated publicly in the past, when her husband gets attacked, he will punch back 10 times harder," her communications director, Stephanie Grisham, said in a statement to CNN.



A number of celebs have since responded in support of Brzezinski.

Earlier this month, Kathy Griffin lost a number of gigs after taking part in a controversial photo shoot, in which she held up a bloodied replica of Trump's head. Griffin has since apologized for the photos, and burst into tears when asked by ET's Kevin Frazier at a press conference if she'd spoken with her former CNN New Year's Eve co-host, Anderson Cooper, after he condemned the photo shoot.
