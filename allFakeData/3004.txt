Brody Jenner Breaks Silence on Caitlyn Jenner Skipping His Wedding

Brody Jenner is breaking his silence after Caitlyn Jenner skipped his wedding this past weekend.

“It was a big disappointment,” the 34-year-old son of the former Olympian told People. “Especially considering that she had known about the wedding for a year.”

“I wasn’t surprised,” he added. “I’m pretty used to her doing that sort of thing.”

Brody and his wife, Kaitlynn Carter, married at the Nihi Sumba Resort on Sumba island, off the coast of Indonesia on Saturday (June 2).
