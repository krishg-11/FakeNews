Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux in 'trial separation'

The magazine claims the couple have been keeping their distance with work taking Justin to Europe, where he’s shooting The Spy Who Dumped Me opposite Mila Kunis, and Jennifer to Georgia where she’s filming Dumplin’.

“Jen and Justin have been struggling,” a source tells the magazine. “They have problems just like everyone else.”

Their reps denied it when approached.

However the publication goes on to quote a source as saying, “Jen was convinced Justin would start putting more time and effort in once The Leftovers ended, but sadly that wasn’t the case.

“With Justin off working, Jen decided to focus on her career too.”

According to Star’s source, Jennifer signed on to star in a TV series with Reese Witherspoon “in an act of defiance. She told him to have a long think about his commitment to their marriage, and he agreed that this may be for the best.”

Now only time will tell what happens!
