US report - 'Flaky' Nicole is 'driving Keith Urban crazy'

The multitasking actress, 50, can’t seem to complete even the simplest of tasks, according to the publication.

“Nicole’s flakiness aggravates Keith to no end,” Globe’s source claims. “The older she gets, the flakier she becomes. She’s go so much on her plate that she can’t keep track.

“She’ll be talking to Keith on the phone long distance, put him on hold and then forget about him.”

Her behaviour is often irksome to others in the movie industry.

“Nicole is notorious for backing out of film projects too,” alleges the source. “She’ll say yes and then she’ll drop the ball.”

The couple have yet to respond to Globe's claims.
