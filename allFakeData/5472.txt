Are Brad Pitt & Elle Macpherson dating? Well, no, they're not actually.

Yesterday rumours swirled that Elle Macpherson had been on an intimate date with Brad Pitt. Well, turns out it's all a load of nonsense.

According to New Idea magazine, sources said the 53-year-old supermodel was spotted with the actor, also 53, at a nightclub in Hollywood.

"They definitely seemed cosy together, like a couple on an intimate date," the source claimed. "She was touching his arm a lot and flicking her hair over her shoulder - there was a lot of flirting going on.'

"He was laughing at everything she said and leaning in really close," they added.

Brad Pitt’s rep has said that the report is “not true,” and that the actor and Macpherson are not dating.

It could have been a dreamy coupling; Macpherson and Pitt first met on the set of Friends in 1999, when Brad guest starred on his then-wife Jennifer Aniston's hit show.

Since his split with Angelina Jolie, Brad has also been linked to Sienna Miller.

Apparently that's untrue, too. Perhaps he's just a single guy.

Brad, call us.
