Sam Asghari

This is a birthday post about a girl named Lucky. Britney Spears turns 38 today! To celebrate, her boyfriend Sam Asghari shared a hilarious throwback video from one of their date nights, and it's the ultimate shout out to his girlfriend's iconic music. On Monday, the actor shared a video of him and his love skating with her song "Break The Ice" playing in the background. He hilariously falls on the rink and joked about the flub in his caption. "We live, we laugh, we argue, and most of all we Love," he wrote. "There's a reason why the world fell in love with you! You might be the princess of pop but mostly you're my princess. Biggest Happy Birthday to you...
