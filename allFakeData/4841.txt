He’s Hired! Ben Affleck Enlists Best Friend Matt Damon To Be His Life Coach Troubled actor now ‘doesn’t make a move without getting feedback' from lifelong pal.

RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned Ben Affleck’s friendship with Matt Damon knows no bounds, and the Justice League star is consulting his pal on everything from his relationship issues to his fashion choices!

“Ben doesn’t make a move without getting feedback from Matt,” an insider revealed. “He has the self-confidence and thick skin that Ben always lacked.”

Affleck, 45, especially trusts 47-year-old Damon now that his ex-wife, Jennifer Garner, isn’t in the picture anymore.

“Matt encouraged Ben to go for it in terms of his relationship with Lindsay Shookus, and he’s coaching him on how to stay off the booze and spruce up his image with more fashionable clothes,” said the insider.

“Ben was looking like a mechanic with his dirty T-shirts and jeans, but Matt helped to change all that.”

Surprisingly, Damon didn’t have any problems with the giant tattoo Affleck recently had inked on his back.

“Matt approved Ben’s phoenix,” said the source.
