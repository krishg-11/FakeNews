Drake suing Pusha T for using black face photo.

Drake is suing Pusha T for 5 Million for using Blackface photo without permission.





Reports are out there that Drake and OVO will be suing Pusha T for suing the blackface photo without permission. The lawsuit is suppose to be for 5 mil. Does this mean Drake has no plans to drop another diss record? Or will he still "respond" to Pusha?
