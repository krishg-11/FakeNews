Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie in new scandal

To add to Jennifer’s drama, Brad Pitt’s wandering eye has once again landed on the gorgeous and talented Margot Robbie.

The pair are co-starring in Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, which has just started production in Los Angeles.

According to an on-set observer, Brad, 54, is clearly smitten with the Aussie beauty.

An insider told Radar Online: ‘Brad is very taken with Margot, and their chemistry is the talk of the cast.’

Sadly for Brad, however, the actress is happily married to Tom Ackerley, whom she wed in 2016.

It’s not the first time Brad’s feelings for Margot have been reported. His crush on the actress was revealed in 2016, a year after he apparently ensured she had a small part in The Big Short, which he produced.
