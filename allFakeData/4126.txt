Jennifer Aniston Is Living Her Life, Dating Two (2) Dudes

Jennifer Aniston, post-Justin Theroux split, is dating again, Us Weekly reports. And already, the rom com star is in a bit of a real-life love triangle: two guys are contending for her affection. The first hopeful is a tech titan, as the outlet describes him, that a friend introduced her to. “He recently split from his wife and is trying to win over Jen,” the source said.

The second “is an industry creative she met when they started working on a project together several months ago," another source said. (Aniston is working on at least three projects currently: Murder Mystery, that morning talk show drama Apple TV series with Reese Witherspoon, and that Netflix series where she'll play the President with Tig Notaro as her First Lady.) Neither Tech Titan or Industry Creative are Aniston's usual type, and her friends are super excited about it and the fact Aniston is dating period. “They can hardly keep it a secret when they’re so happy to see Jen moving on," a source said.

Aniston is being cautious though, a friend told the outlet. “As strong as Jen is, she tends to be very wary of new people. It normally takes a while for her to open up and trust someone.”
