Justin Theroux Is Proud To Stand Behind Jennifer Aniston

Throughout his "Girl on the Train" press tour, actor Justin Theroux has been asked plenty of questions about his real-life leading lady, wife Jennifer Aniston. Since marrying Aniston last August, Theroux has openly discussed his relationship with his wife, often praising her for her poise when attacked by the tabloids.

"Many people would have crumbled under some of the stresses that have been put on her. Iâ€™m very proud of her for that, for the way she handles herself," he told The Sunday Times. Earlier this year, Aniston wrote a powerful piece about body shaming and pregnancy pressures for The Huffington Post. Theroux showed his support of the opinion piece by sharing the link to it on his Instagram page with the caption: #wcw Here's just one reason why.
