Kim Kardashian Fires Publicist For A Political Image

Image Overhaul! Kim Hiring New Team To Seem More 'Political' Kardashian is ready to revamp her reputation.

Kim Kardashian is looking for a more political image, RadarOnline.com can exclusively report.

“Kim is looking to hire a political publicist, and Kanye is heading up the search,” an insider told Radar.

West’s wife, 36, recently expressed her desire to become more politically active in Harper’s Bazaar Arabia, saying: “Sometimes I feel like I want to speak out more about political issues.You have to be really careful about what you say, because a lot of things can be taken in the wrong context and I always want to be respectful; I don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings.”

“I said once before that I’m not really a feminist,” she added. “But I feel I do a lot more than people that claim that they’re feminist. To clarify what I said before: I feel in my soul I’m a feminist. I just don’t need labels to make me feel or know what I am inside. Modern feminists are all the girls around us today. Every time you look on social media and there’s someone standing up for themselves, to me that’s a modern feminist. There’s such an amazing group of girls that empower each other.”

Meanwhile, the mom-of-two just celebrated the upcoming arrival of her second daughter at a baby shower over the weekend. North was in attendance, but her son Saint, 1, was nowhere to be found.
