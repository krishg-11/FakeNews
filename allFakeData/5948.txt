Kelly Ripa came to the defense of her embattled “Live!” co-host Ryan Seacrest on Thursday by declaring on the air: “I just want you to know, you are a privilege to work with, and I adore you.”

She added that she is looking forward to seeing Seacrest on the Oscars red carpet, and, “Speaking on behalf of all of us here, I know what an easy, professional, great person you are, and I feel very, very lucky to work with you each and every day.”

Seacrest has denied claims that he sexually harassed his former stylist Suzie Hardy while she was employed by the E! network.

Ripa’s endorsement came just a day after she appeared to take a dig at Seacrest on the show, with regards to the sexual-misconduct allegations plaguing him.

And insiders tell us that the duo’s relationship is not as sunny as it seemed on the show Thursday.

Said a source: “Kelly doesn’t want to risk anything happening to ‘Live’ . . . She is understandably livid because it could potentially f - - k up her show.”

Another added, “They oversell their friendship . . . Her reputation is rolled up in this — this is her show. For Kelly, there’s not a Plan B. She has to make a decision and rally around him.”

Reps did not comment, but another source insisted, “He’s one of her closest friends, and they’re very protective of each other. They’ve known each other for years and talk about everything . . . it’s been a tough week.”

E! is sticking with Seacrest as a red-carpet Oscars host, though sources told Page Six some stars may steer clear of him, while the network will line up only friendly interviews.
