Oprah Winfrey says she is waiting for 'sign from God' to run for US president

Oprah Winfrey has said she is waiting for a "sign from God" to tell her to run in the 2020 US presidential election.

The talk show host said she has been approached by billionaires offering to fund and run her campaign if she chose to run for the White House.

Winfrey was first seen as a potential Democratic candidate after her rousing speech at the Golden Globes gained traction with viewers across the world.

“I went into prayer,” she said of the calls and speculation around a possible run for president.

“I had people - wealthy, billionaires - calling me up and saying, ‘I can get you a billion dollars. I can run your campaign',” she told US magazine People.
