Goldie Hawn: Why she left longtime partner Kurt Russell

The Hollywood couple are famously unmarried and have an “elasticity” to their relationship, but that doesn’t mean they don’t still argue and things have got bad enough for them to call their whole relationship off.

An insider told American Closer magazine: “Their open relationship got complicated. It led to a separation which was a real game changer in their relationship. The day she left Kurt was their greatest test.”

Goldie and Kurt met on the set of 1983 movie Swing Shift and they quickly established an unconventional set of boundaries for their relationship. They never married but they had a son, Wyatt, 31, in 1986, and both had children from previous relationships.

One of the hiccups in their relationship came in 2004 when Goldie flew to India where she met the dashing former Pakistani cricketer Imran Khan, making Kurt jealous.

The insider added: “Kurt was in a mood yelling at his co-stars. They were both acting out a little, and he was on a jealousy kick that hadn’t really shown itself. They called an adult time out to get some space so tempers would cool.”

Kurt told Goldie he didn’t want to see her for a while, and the source explained: “She was really worried and she headed to their house in Malibu while Kurt stayed at their home in the Pacific Palisades. It was rough.”

The insider told Closer that ultimately the couple made up again and decided their relationship was for the long haul, and their children were a big part of that decision.

The source added: “They move forward and don’t dwell on the past. They forgive themselves and each other for their failings and they preach to their kids to be forgiving too.”

Goldie and Kurt have yet to comment on Closer's allegations.
