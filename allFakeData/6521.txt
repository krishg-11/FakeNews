Rumors of a Rihanna pregnancy have been swirling around the pop star for months now. While there is still no official confirmation, some believe new photos prove that the singer is pregnant…

According to MTO News, Rihanna recently took part in a secret photo shoot in Ibiza.

Although it’s unknown what the shoot was for, the singer appeared to be more full-figured than normal. Some are also saying that they can see a visible baby bump through her sheer white dress.
