Justin Theroux Speaks Out On Brangelina's Divorce

Even Justin Theroux has thoughts about Brangelina's divorce.

The actor, who's married to Brad Pitt's ex-wife, Jennifer Aniston, spoke with Business Insider this week about the news while promoting his new movie, "The Girl on the Train."

"As a child of divorce, all I can say is that's terrible news for those children, and that's all you can really say," Theroux said, referring to Angelina Jolie and Pitt's six children. "It's boring to sort of comment on anything else. People are having a bad time â€” that's horrible."

Theroux continued, saying he believes it's "nonsense" that Aniston is being talked about in relation to Pitt and Jolie's divorce.

"There's an endless appetite for trash, apparently, though everyone would say that they don't have that appetite," Theroux said.

"But I think a lot of people do because people buy it. But there are bigger things to b*tch about. It's shocking how much bandwidth things can take up when there are far more important things going on in the world."

Almost as soon as news broke that Angelina Jolie had filed for divorce from her husband of two years (and partner of 12), Jennifer Aniston was brought into the conversation, even though she and Pitt divorced in 2005 after five years of marriage.

Memes and gifs of Aniston's "reaction" to the divorce sprouted up, and tabloids began to speculate on what she said when she heard the news.
