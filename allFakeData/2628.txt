Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux Fighting About Living in NYC

There’s trouble in paradise — again! Life & Style can exclusively reveal that Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux — who tied the knot in August 2015 after several years of dating — are clashing over living in the big NYC.

“Jen loves Justin, but she just doesn’t want to live in the Big Apple any more than she has to,” said a source, adding the Friends alum has “given NYC her best

shot.” The Leftovers star is a big apple boy, and they originally agreed that Jen would spend her time there with him when she wasn’t filming. Fortunately, the source continued, “They’re trying to work it out.”

Fans may be somewhat shocked by this, considering last month Life & Style revealed the Wanderlust co-stars had a case of baby fever. An eyewitness spotted them at Emilio’s Ballato in NYC and recalled, “When I picked up my son, Justin pointed at him and motioned to Jen, and she turned around to smile at him. They seemed to be so smitten at the sight of children.” We certainly hope they can work things out — because we’d love to see them become parents together!

This comes on the heels of reports that Jen reconnected with her ex-husband, Brad Pitt, after splitting in 2005 when he met Angelina Jolie on the set of Mr. & Mrs. Smith. “Brad wouldn’t dream of breaking up Jen’s marriage,” a source told In Touch last month. “Brad’s leaning on her as a confidante now. His renewed relationship with Jen has been a huge source of support and comfort through the toughest year of his life.”
