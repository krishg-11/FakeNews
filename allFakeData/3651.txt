Ivanka Trump Us Weekly Cover Memes

Ivanka Trump is on the cover of the newest issue of Us Weekly with a story titled, "Ivanka Takes a Stand: Why I Disagree with My Dad." The subtitle elaborates: "Balancing her personal ideals with love and loyalty to her father, the president's daughter will always fight for what she believes in."

Interesting.

The story states that the First Daughter has disagreed with her father on "everything from LGBT rights to the North American Free Trade Agreement." She reportedly even "openly tried to sway him" to remain in the Paris Agreement (which President Trump withdrew from last week).

Naturally, the internet promptly responded to the cover story in a genius way. Tweeters started posting photos of famous TV and movie characters who also dealt with evil (or at least misguided) fathers. The caption? "Why I Disagree With My Dad."

From Luke Skywalker to Sally Draper, take a look at the hilarious responses below.
