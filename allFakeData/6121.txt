Watch Rihanna Learn How to Use a Gun for Her ‘Needed Me’ Video

Strippers, nudity, and violence have been common motifs in Rihanna’s recent visuals. “Needed Me,” which dropped on 4/20, follows that trend to a T, with a key difference being how the ANTI songstress had to go through some extra training to pull the video off.

Rihanna released a pair of behind-the-scenes videos today (April 25), and Part 2 features her learning how to shoot a gun. The new skill comes in handy during the climax of the “Needed Me” video, in which she catches a body in a strip club. The features also show Rihanna riding a motorcycle and, of course, chilling in her see-through gown.
