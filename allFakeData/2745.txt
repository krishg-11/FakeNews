Cindy Crawford Says Daughter Kaia Gerber ''Loves Kendall Jenner''

Watch out, Cindy Crawford: it's almost time for daughter Kaia Gerber to follow in your footsteps.

E! News caught up with the 49-year-old beauty at the NYC signing of her book Becoming, which hit shelves on Sept. 29, where she dished on her stunning 14-year-old daughter (and mini-me!) Kaia Gerber, who, at a very young age, has already landed a number of notable modeling gigs.

"She's such a great girl, both my kids are incredible," Crawford, who is also a mom to 16-year-old Presley, gushed. "And Kaia's smart, she's got her head on straight."
