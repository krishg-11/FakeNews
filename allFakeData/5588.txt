Ben Affleck Called a 'Pig' After Rumors Surface He's Ready to Marry Girlfriend Lindsay Shookus

Ben and Lindsay "started" dating shortly after he and Jennifer Garner filed for divorce in April 2017, though their relationship timeline is questionable.

Sources told People Ben and Lindsay had an affair back in 2013 -- just two years before Ben and Jen officially separated. "They would fly back and forth, but he would mostly visit her in New York," the insider alleged to the magazine. "They didn't hide â€¦ They would use the Mandarin Oriental [hotel]. They were regulars."

The pair separated in 2015, though Life & Style reports things haven't progressed since their initial court filings.
