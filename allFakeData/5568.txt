Beyonce & Jay Z Divorce Report: The Custody Battle Over Blue Ivy

As rumors swirl that Beyonce and Jay Z might be headed for splitsville, a new report reveals that Blue Ivy Carter would be at the center of their divorce — and which one of them wants full custody, no questions asked.

Beyonce, 34, is not going down without a fight in her alleged divorce from Jay Z, 45. As the shocking claims about their split get worse and worse, Blue Ivy, 3, seems to be their next battle royale. Will their little girl become the center of a tug of war event? To hear more about Beyonce and Jay Z, head over to iTunes and download the latest HollywoodLife podcast for free!



Even though everyone at HollywoodLife.com is in a Jayonce prayer circle hoping that InTouchWeekly‘s Sept. 21 issue reporting their marriage is over is just a cruel joke, things seem to be getting serious. The latest report reveals that it’s Beyonce who would not only want, but desperately fight to get full custody of their daughter, Blue Ivy.

“She absolutely wants full custody,” a source close to Beyonce told the magazine. “Although she’s prepared to offer Jay visitation.” Ouch. That will be a harsh blow to Jay, especially since the family of three have spent so much time traveling the world together for the past year or so.

For now, all we can do is cross our fingers and hope that all of this Jayonce drama will blow over. Not only are they perfect together on a personal level, but when they work together — more specifically, perform together — it’s like magic. Don’t take the magic away from us, Jayonce!

Tell us, HollywoodLifers — Do you think Beyonce and Jay Z will really split? Who do you think deserves custody? Comment below with your thoughts.
