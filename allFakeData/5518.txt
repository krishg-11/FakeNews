Kylie Jenner's pregnancy brought her closer to Kourtney Kardashian

Kylie Jenner's pregnancy has "helped her bond" with Kourtney Kardashian.

The 'Keeping Up With The Kardashians' star has always been close to her sister Khloé Kardashian but has grown closer to her eldest sibling Kourtney now she is expecting.

A source said: "She's always been closest to Khloé, but this pregnancy has helped her bond with Kourtney. She thinks Kourtney is an amazing hands-on mom, and that's how she wants to be. She also reads a lot online and wants to learn as much as possible. Kourtney is encouraging her to learn about natural and organic living. Kylie is doing organic diapers and ointment."

And the 20-year-old television personality - who is expecting her first child with her partner Travis Scott - is excited that Khloe is pregnant at the same time too.

The insider added to People magazine: "It's also helped having Khloé go through everything with [Kylie] at the same time. She thinks it's really special that they're pregnant together."

And ahead of the baby's arrival, Kylie has already baby-proofed her house.

A source shared: "The nursery is done. She's a go-getter like her mother [Kris Jenner]. No way she waited long to set that up! ... Anything sharp has already been taken out.

"She's very happy about the pregnancy but she doesn't want to share this with the world. Her not being out is strictly personal preference. She wants to keep this one aspect of her life private. She spent her adolescent life on television and has been famous for over 10 years now. If this is the first thing she wants to keep to herself, she should be allowed that. She's worked hard enough to do whatever she wants."
