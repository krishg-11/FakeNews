Star cover story of ‘Kim-Kanye $1 billion divorce’ busted by Gossip Cop

Share this article:

Star magazine’s new cover claims “Kim & Kanye’s $1 billion divorce announcement” is full of made-up or quotes and conjecture.

And: “To the shock of no one, the lemmings at Hollywood Life have already picked up this false report.”

So says Gossip Cop, the celebrity hoax-busting site, which also said of Hollywood Life: We’ll be on the look-out for them to flip-flop with the ‘truth’ in the coming days.”

Posted Wednesday, the story by Shari Weiss focuses on a cover quote supposedly from Kim Kardashian that “I’ll raise our surrogate baby alone.”

The source of the comment in Star is unidentified, however.

“It’s actually the alleged source speculating, ‘She would be completely fine raising the baby alone.’ That has a far different implication than what readers are told on the cover,” Weiss writes.

The Hollywood Life story by Samantha Wilson begins: “This is so sad! Kim Kardashian, 37, is reportedly at her wits end when it comes to dealing with husband Kanye West, 40. She’s struggled since Kanye’s terrifying November 2016 breakdown, and she reportedly can’t see a light at the end of the tunnel, according to an insider who spoke to Star Magazine.”
