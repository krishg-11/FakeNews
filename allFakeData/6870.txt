How Meghan Markle's uninvited family crashed the royal wedding

Meghan Markle lived out a fantasy most women could only dream of on May 19, 2018. The American actress married Prince Harry in a public ceremony in St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in front of 600 guests, as well as thousands of onlookers gathered outside to catch a glimpse of the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex.

Though the wedding was well-attended both in person and by tens of millions watching live at home, there were some glaring absencesâ€” namely, much of Markle's family. In fact, the only Markles to score invites to the royal wedding were Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, and her father, Thomas Markle. Her mom made it, but her dad was unable to attend following a series of embarrassing tabloid debacles and emergency heart surgery.

After watching the nuptials from the hospital, Thomas expressed joy for his daughter, and also nicely summed up the drama caused by his extended family.' "Now I pray that Harry and Meghan can go on a nice honeymoon and rest and relax, and all of my relatives will just shut up about everything," he told TMZ. Wow! Let's jump right into that and take a closer look at how Meghan Markle's uninvited family members crashed the royal wedding.
