Ethan Hawke Is on Angelina Jolie’s Christmas Card List





Tell Us how to get on that list! Ethan Hawke revealed to USA Today on Tuesday, Jan. 6, that he and his Taking Lives costar Angelina Jolie still keep in touch — via holiday cards!

“Every now and then, I get a Christmas card,” the Boyhood actor, 44, told the paper.

He then reflected on what it was like to work alongside Jolie over ten years ago, before she had even started her romance with now-husband Brad Pitt. In 2003 (when Taking Lives was filmed), Jolie had recently filed for divorce from Billy Bob Thornton and was raising her eldest son Maddox, then 2, on her own.

A year later, the Lara Croft: Tomb Raider actress would meet the love of her life Pitt, with whom she would eventually share six children.

“I worked with her at a very interesting moment in her life,” Hawke, 44, recalled. “It’s pretty awesome what she’s doing. People wanted her to be Marilyn Monroe. They wanted her to burn out. She was about as punk rock as a movie star could be. I loved her for it.”

Hawke praised the Unbroken director for her work as a humanitarian. “She’s taken all that energy and turned that into being a substantive human being,” the Before Sunrise star noted. “The fact that Angelina has transcended the way the world objectified her and is making serious films, she deserves all the positive things that are happening.”
