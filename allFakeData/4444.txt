“I thought I couldn’t be in labor,” yoga pro Hilaria tells Us Weekly of her early morning pains. Earlier that same day a doctor had told the spouses of three years that their baby boy was still two weeks away from arriving.

But it turns out the doc was wrong and Hilaria had a 23-hour labor ahead of her. The 31-year-old cofounder of NYC’s Yoga Vida admitted she was in tears after the birth of her son while Alec, 57, was in awe.

“It’s his first son,” she says.”He can’t even believe it,” adding, “Alec does other things, not change diapers.”

The family of four, including the couple’s 22-month-old daughter Carmen, posed for an exclusive newborn photo shoot taken by Hilaria’s pal Eroula Dimitriou in the couple’s NYC home.

“She wants to kiss him, hold him, sing to him, and feed him food he can’t eat,” Hilaria tells Us of Carmen. “She’s a good big sister.”

As for the family’s plans to expand (Alec is also dad to 19-year-old Ireland Baldwin with ex-wife Kim Basinger), Hilaria notes, “I think we’ll have one more eventually.”
