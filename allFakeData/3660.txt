Meet Kate Hudson's Boyfriend and Baby Daddy

Kate Hudson is an absolute powerhouse (see: her interview in the Women's Health December issue for proof). She's an actress, business mogul and mom of three who still manages to find time for self-care and three to four workouts a week (including pole dancing!). But her crazy schedule wouldn't be nearly as manageable without a little help from her boyfriend and baby daddy Danny Fujikawa.

“I’ve got the best man,” Kate told WH. “It’s the first time I feel like I have a real teammate in this. We’re able to pick up where the other one has to leave off.”

A partnership like this doesn't happen by accident, though. Kate, 40 and Danny, 33, have a long, adorable history. Here's everything you need to know about Kate's longtime friend—and now boyfriend and baby daddy—Danny Fujikawa.



The two made their first debut as a couple in May 2017...

It was at the premiere of Snatched in LA, where Kate and Danny first kissed and posed for photos together on a red carpet. “My cute man. He’s the best!” she told Extra at the premiere. And, when she was asked what she loves most about him, she said, “How long do you have? He’s a good man.” But rumors about their relationship started popping up in March of the same year, since the couple was spotted kissing during a lunch date in Los Angeles, according to People.

...But Danny and Kate knew each other for years before they started dating.

Kate said in an Instagram post in December 2017 that she first met Danny when she was 23 and pregnant with her son, Ryder. Danny's step-sisters are Kate’s best friends, she says, so they’ve been in the same circles for years.

“A year ago today Danny took me on a hike and what I thought was just a hike with a family friend turned very quickly into an unexpected first date,” Kate wrote in her Instagram caption. “No moves were made on this first date. In fact, it took months for him to make a first move! And as a kiss on this bridge would have been nice, the kiss a year later was so much sweeter. So on our 15th year of knowing each other we were able to open our hearts to each other to feel so much pure love and it’s been truly incredible!

He's a total family man.

Kate has two children, Ryder Russell Robinson, 15, and Bingham Hawn Bellamy, 8, from previous relationships with Chris Robinson and Matt Bellamy, respectively. She also has a daughter, 1, with Danny. Kate and Danny have found a way to make blended family life work for them.

“If I have to go to a dinner meeting, he can be home,” Kate told WH. “His number one priority is family. And when we have our disputes, I feel the thing that allows us to get through them is having the same ultimate goal, and that includes being in each other’s life. It just feels so nice.”

They welcomed their first child together in October 2018.

The actress posted a simple Instagram photo that reads: "10-2-18" on top of a pink background. "She’s here 💕" Kate shared in the caption.



Kate, 38, also wrote that she and boyfriend Danny Fujikawa decided to name their daughter Rani Rose Hudson Fujikawa. (It's their first baby together, btw!)

“We have decided to name our daughter Rani (pronounced Ronnie) after her grandfather, Ron Fujikawa. Ron was the most special man who we all miss dearly. To name her after him is an honor,” Kate wrote in her announcement post.

She added: “Everyone is doing well and happy as can be. Our family thanks you for all the love and blessings that have been sent our way and we send ours right back.”

They were very excited for Rani's arrival.

Kate told People that she "[looks] forward to having feminine energy" around.

And her brothers Oliver Hudson and Wyatt Russell confirmed both she and Danny were very excited about their daughter on the way.

“I was teary-eyed because I know how badly she wanted a girl,” he told PEOPLE in April. “I know Danny, I’m sure in some part of every man’s brain you’re like, ‘I’d love to have a little me.’”

Wyatt added: “But when he met my brother’s little girl Rio, who’s the cutest thing in the entire world, she made him be like, ‘Okay, I want a girl.’ So they’re really excited.”

Both Danny and Kate went into full-blown nesting mode.

In Kate's Instagram story at the end of September 2018, Kate posted a series of photos that revealed she and Danny were prepping their baby's nursery as they eagerly awaited her arrival.

The story pics included a poll about wallpaper, a photo of the bassinet they chose for the room, and finally a photo of Danny wearing a baby carrier with the caption "I think someone's ready to go!"

They announced Kate's pregnancy in the cutest (and realest) way.

Kate and her honey first announced they were expecting a baby girl together back in April 2018 with an Instagram video. The post showed the couple—along with Kate's sons Ryder (from her former marriage with Chris Robinson) and Bingham (from her former relationship with Matt Bellamy)—popping four huge balloons that contained pink confetti. (Cue everyone screaming.)

“SURPRISE!!! If you’ve wondered why I’ve been so absent on my social channels it’s because I have never been more sick!” Kate wrote in the caption. “[It] was the most sick first trimester of all my children. Boomerangs have made me nauseous, Superzoom is an easy way to have my head in the toilet, food Instagrams make me [queasy] and thinking too much about Insta stories made me even more exhausted than I already had been.”

Danny fits in perfectly with Kate's family.

Following the actress's birthday, Kate posted this cute pic with Danny, along with the caption: "#tbt To my favorite birthday moment. You can’t really see my kiddos in the front but I was getting love from all my boys at once. #FeelingLucky"

Danny is a musician.

Danny is another musician—like Kate’s former husband Chris Robinson and ex Matt Bellamy. Danny is the former singer and guitarist for the band Chief.

He also owns the record label Lightwave Records, which he started in 2013 with The Delta Mirror frontman Chris Acosta, according to the label’s Facebook page.



He worked on Kate's promo videos for her clothing line.

Danny can officially add professional Instagram/social media boyfriend to his resume. In a recent post, he shared a video for Kate's clothing line Happy x Nature, that he not only edited but composed the music for too!

He captioned the video, "Here lies the teaser I edited and musically composed for my baby’s new “ready-to-wear” clothing line. Of all the clothes in the world that are ready to wear, these are the most ready. #happyxnature #THX"

And of course, Kate looks amazing.

He clearly has a great sense of humor.

Kate's boo seems like a pretty hilarious guy. He regularly posts pics on Instagram of himself doing funny things like posing in a sheet mask and “crying” after he shaved off his long beard.

They've traveled the world together.

It's clear from their Instagrams that these two love to travel and share experiences together. The couple have sailed in Cambodia, hit the skii slopes for Valentine’s Day and just recently went to Dubai, where Kate and Danny gave falconry a try.

Even while Kate was six months pregnant with Rani, the couple took a "babymoon" trip and traveled through Italy, with friends and family.

Marriage is something they're considering.

In a recent interview with The Telegraph, Kate said getting married to Fujikawa is a definite possibility. "We think about that a lot. Marriage is definitely not a golden ticket—it's not going to solve any challenges in a relationship. But as someone who's lived through…well, trial and error, I think that the symbolism of marriage, that commitment, is more important to kids than we sometimes think," Kate said.
