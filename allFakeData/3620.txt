George Clooney Shows Off Pics of His Twins, Jokes They’re Like Models

George Clooney is one proud papa! The Academy Award winner showed off pics of his twins with wife Amal while attending a Casamigos House of Friends Dinner at TAO in L.A. on Friday, June 8.

The Tomorrowland actor, 57, was casually dressed as he attended the party solo and sipped on a pineapple margarita at the event celebrating his tequila brand.

Standing with pals including Casamigos cofounder and close friend Rande Gerber, Clooney pulled out his phone, which has a background photo of his kids, Ella and Alexander, who turned 1 on June 6.

“George told a funny story about how he and Amal have to keep the toilet seat down for the twins’ sake and then he started showing his friends photos of them,” an eyewitness tells Us Weekly. “George teased that the babies are like models and he never has to show them how to pose because they do it so naturally. He seemed like the proudest parent and just couldn’t stop showing photos and talking about how much he loves the kids.”

Clooney’s wife, 40, paid tribute to her husband’s parenting skills when he was presented with an AFI Lifetime Achievement Award on Thursday, June 7. Taking the stage, the British lawyer gave a sweet speech, saying that the star “is the person who has my complete admiration and also the person whose smile makes me melt every time.”

Addressing him directly, she added, “My love, what I have found with you is the great love I always hoped existed. And seeing you with our children, Ella and Alexander, is the greatest joy in my life.”
