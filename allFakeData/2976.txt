Blake Lively keeps dark secret from Anna Kendrick in A Simple Favor trailer

A Simple Favor 09/14/18 type Movie Genre Thriller

Like Blake Lively’s recently purged Instagram photos, the actress’ latest character has gone missing in the new trailer for Bridesmaids helmer Paul Feig’s upcoming mystery A Simple Favor.

“I do consider Emily my best friend. She’s this wonderful, elegant person,” Anna Kendrick (as Stephanie) says of Lively’s character in the preview, which the latter debuted Wednesday morning via her Twitter account. Crazy Rich Asians star Henry Golding, who plays Emily’s husband, Sean, continues: “She is an enigma, my wife. You can get close to her, but never quite reach her.”

As quick flashes of police sirens, a violent car crash, and deliciously smirky glances flash onscreen, Emily reminds us: “Everybody has a dark side. Some of us are better at hiding it than others.”

The biggest reveal the trailer presents, however, is Emily grinning in a crimson wig after Stephanie explains: “Five days ago, Emily went missing. I’m realizing I don’t know her as well as I thought I did. Emily, if you’re out there, we’re all really worried!”

In anticipation of the trailer’s release, Lively sent fans into a tizzy Monday by deleting all of her Instagram posts save for a single photo of a hangman-style game which spelled out the question, “What happened to Emily?” As of Wednesday, Lively unfollowed most of the accounts she previously tracked, and is now following only women named Emily Nelson — 37 of them, to be exact.

A Simple Favor — also starring Rupert Friend, Jean Smart, Linda Cardellini, Andrew Rannells, and Sarah Baker — is set for release on Sept. 14. Watch the film’s trailer above.
