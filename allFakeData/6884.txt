Jim Carrey, Robert De Niro Lead Celebrity Tributes to Jerry Lewis: 'He Didn't Miss a Beat, Or a Punchline'

The world is reeling after news of Jerry Lewis’ death.

Stars like Josh Gad, Jim Carrey, Dane Cook and more have penned moving tributes to the late comedian just moments after news of Lewis’ death broke.

Cook remembered his fellow comedian in a series of tweets, calling Lewis his “mentor and friend.”

“A visionary. A pioneer in all forms of entertainment. A charitable human. A father,” he wrote. Cook added: “He meant the world to me& I will forever cherish the time I got to spend with him & his family. At a dark time in my life he brought me joy.”

Actor Nicolas Cage, who starred with Lewis in the 2016 film, The Trust, feels the comedian’s death “marks the end of the golden age of entertainment,” he told PEOPLE in a statement. “He was my inspiration since I was five. His movies saved my childhood and his extraordinary charisma informed all my performances. I would always ask myself, ‘What would Jerry do?'”

Cage added that Lewis “is always on my mind. He was my friend and my neighbor. He was ‘The Total Filmmaker — writer, director, star, and I am deeply saddened that we can’t talk a little more.”

Lewis’ Nutty Professor costar Stella Stevens told PEOPLE she was deeply saddened to learn the news of his death.

“Jerry was a comic genius, and every day on set I learned so much about filmmaking from him,” she said in a statement. “The Nutty Professor remains very close to my heart. Flights of angels, dear man. Love, your Miss Purdy.”

Dick Gregory and Jerry Lewis in a 12 hour span? That shit happens in threes. I'm rollin' up in bubble wrap and layin' on the floor & whatnot — George Wallace (@MrGeorgeWallace) August 20, 2017

The death comes about two months after Lewis was hospitalized in Las Vegas with a urinary tract infection — the latest in a history of health issues.

In June 2006, Lewis suffered a mild heart attack in San Diego. Still, his manager told PEOPLE at the time, “He’s doing very well. He’ll be standing on that stage at the [Jerry Lewis Muscular Dystrophy Association] telethon on Labor Day.”

In its time, the annual fundraiser, which Lewis started in 1966 (he stopped hosting as of 2010), is said to have raised more than $2 billion for medical research.

Prior to his heart attack, Lewis had long faced health problems, and in June 2012 was rushed to the hospital with low blood sugar only minutes before he was expected to present an award to Tom Cruise at a New York Friars Club event.

Still, Lewis has managed to maintain his popularity, and legend-status during his decades-long career. His manic style amused generations of moviegoers on both sides of the Atlantic, and his popularity often confounded critics.
