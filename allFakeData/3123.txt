David Cassidy, Fighting Memory Loss, Wants to 'Enjoy Life'

FILE - Actor-singer David Cassidy, best known for his role as Keith Partridge on "The Partridge Family," arrives at the ABC Disney Summer press tour party in Pasadena, Calif., Aug. 8, 2009. Cassidy, now 66, told People Magazine in a recent interview that he is struggling with memory loss related to dementia.

Former "Partridge Family" star David Cassidy says he's struggling with memory loss.

The 66-year-old actor-singer tells People magazine his family has a history of dementia and he had sensed "this was coming." He says for now he wants to stay focused and "enjoy life."

Cassidyâ€™s revelation follows a recent concert in Agoura Hills, California, where he reportedly struggled to remember lyrics to songs he had been singing for nearly 50 years.

The performer has had numerous personal problems in the decades following his initial success, ranging from substance abuse to bankruptcy. He's the stepson of actress and fellow "Partridge Family" star Shirley Jones.

Cassidy had announced early this year that he planned to wrap up his 50-year career by the end of 2017.

In a statement at the time, Cassidy said that "traveling and my arthritis" have made performing around the country difficult in recent years.

The one-time "Partridge Family" heartthrob said at the time that his retirement was "not a complete 'Good bye' but I'm planning on working much less."
