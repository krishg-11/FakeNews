Tom Cruise's secret correspondence with daughter Suri

As far as the wider world is aware, Tom Cruise has not seen his daughter, Suri, for more than five years.

Insiders revealed to Star magazine that the reason Suri is allegedly not allowed to speak to her father publicly is that of his position in the Scientology community as well as concerns from Katie Holmes that her only daughter could become "brainwashed" by the community.

"It's not surprising that Suri is confused by the lack of communication between her parents," the source told the publication.

"She's growing up, asking more questions and it's becoming harder to shield her from the whispers. She wants to speak to her dad."

Tom has never actually given a reason as to why he no longer sees his youngest child.
