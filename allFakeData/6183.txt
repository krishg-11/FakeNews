Khloe Kardashian Claps Back At Plastic Surgery Rumours With "Pregnancy Lips" Claim

Khloe Kardashian has no doubt gone through a major physical transformation over the years. Her results could potentially be attributed to plastic surgery according to ongoing rumours. Recently, her plump lips have been at the centre of this discussion. Many have noticed a huge difference in the size of the public figure's lips. The noise was enough for the television star to address the issue on her Instagram account.

The new mother acknowledged the noticeable change in her features in an IG story post.

"PSA I was pregnant during this entire season of KUWTK. Some women get 'pregnancy lips'. I was one of them. So my lips look crazy and massive. Trust me I know and I HATED it! A lot of wild sh*t happens to your body and face while pregnant. It's out of our control."

Kardashian urges fans of the reality television show to be kind about her onscreen transformation.

"Most people don't have to film during an entire pregnancy so just watch the show and be kind about my growing body and lips. Pregnant women should be off limits."

Her younger sister, Kylie Jenner, has become a cosmetics mogul thanks to her artificially enhanced lips. Khloe seemed adamant in rejecting claims of her attempting a similar strategy.
