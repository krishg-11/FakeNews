Emmy Awards 2017: The winners list

The Handmaid’s Tale, Big Little Lies, Atlanta, and Veep were among the big winners at Sunday’s 69th annual Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony.

The Emmy winners list included six honors for Hulu’s Handmaid’s Tale, including the coveted Best Drama Series trophy. HBO’s Big Little Lies won five total, including Best Limited Series, while Veep nabbed Best Comedy series.

With 22 nods, Westworld tied Saturday Night Live for the most nominated show this year, though it didn’t end up winning any statues at Sunday’s show. (It picked up a few during the Creative Arts Emmys last weekend, though.) Saturday Night Live, however, won six awards, including Best Variety Sketch Series.

Master of None‘s Lena Waithe made history by being the first black woman to win a writing Emmy, while Atlanta‘s Donald Glover is the first black director to win an Emmy for directing a comedy series. This Is Us star Sterling K. Brown became the first black actor to win the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series award since 1998, when Andre Braugher won for his performance on NBC’s Homicide: Life on the Street.

Other notable achievements included Julia Louis-Dreyfus winning her sixth consecutive Emmy for Veep, and Elisabeth Moss winning her first ever Emmy for her starring role on The Handmaid’s Tale after being nominated six times before for Top of the Lake and Mad Men.
