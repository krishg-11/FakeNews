Katie Holmes Reignites Friendship With James Van Der Beek To Make Jamie Foxx Jealous

Katie Holmes Reignites Friendship With James Van Der Beek To Make Jamie Jealous! Co-stars rekindle as Foxx flirts with other women.

Katie Holmes has reignited her friendship with Dawson’s Creek co-star James Van Der Beek in the wake of her split from Jamie Foxx, and sources tell RadarOnline.com exclusively sparks are flying!

“Katie’s spent a lot of lonely nights without Jamie Foxx and is reading all the reports of his flirting with other women. So she’s decided two can play at that game, and has gotten back in touch with James.”

And Van Der Beek “was thrilled,” snitched the source.

The actor, who is happily married to Kimberly Brook whom he shares five children with, “has always carried a torch for Katie when they worked together and he still feels like there could be chemistry between them,” reveals the informant.

The duo are said to be “keeping it platonic,” however.

As fans know, the 39-year-old is reportedly having relationship problems with her on-and-off boyfriend Foxx as he was seen hanging out with his baby mama several times this month and Holmes was not happy about it!

Foxx was caught earlier this month partying hard at an Oscars afterparty. Holmes was nowhere in sight.
