Selena Gomez Really Wants A Kiss From Justin Bieber On New Year’s Eve!

Sources close to the superstar have revealed that Selena Gomez wants something very specific as the clock strikes midnight on New Year’s Eve. Apparently, if she gets to kiss her lover Justin Bieber, she’s going to be the happiest woman in the world! How cute is that?

After showing the entire world that after years of straying from one another their love was still strong enough to bring them back together, the pair has been doing better than ever.

That being said, is there really a more significant way to celebrate their fateful reunion than locking lips as a new year – that they are hopefully going to spend together – is born?

‘Selena has one wish for the New Year’s Eve plans and that’s to get a romantic kiss from Justin at midnight. After a rocky year, and a lot of family drama surrounding Christmas, Selena’s eager to spend her New Year’s Eve with Justin,’ one source close to the singer claims.

‘She’s happy they found their way back to each other this year and Selena’s never felt better about her future with Justin. When the clock strikes midnight on New Year’s Eve, she wants to be with her man, wherever that may be, so she can feel Bieber’s arms around her and get a sweet kiss from him as 2018 begins,’ the insider added. So sweet!

But despite the fact that their unexpected reunion generally made fans very happy, not everyone was all for it.

As you may know by now, Selena’s family, her mother, in particular, is heartbroken about her decision to take Justin back.
