Everything to Know About Kylie and Tyga's Relationship

Kylie Jenner and Tyga used to drive fans wild with their “Are they or aren’t they?” relationship after getting together in 2014. There were engagement and breakup rumors. They appeared on each other’s Instagram accounts. They shot down pregnancy rumors. And they took their romance to the next level: Snapchat. (Hands up if that video of Kylie “kissing” Tyga’s grill comes to mind right away.)



Even though it’s all over now, take a look back at how Kyga came to be.

November 2011: Kendall Jenner’s Sweet Sixteen birthday party is one of the first encounters between Kylie and Tyga. The latter performs for the very underage crowd, including a 14-year-old Kylie. Make what you will of the brief flirting, if you can even call it that.

July 2014: Tyga makes what many Kyga fans believe is his first appearance on Kylie’s Instagram feed. Kendall and Chris Brown are there for the hang too.

August 2014: Tyga celebrates Kylie’s 17th birthday and even offers her a shot of tequila while she’s dancing on some platform. Days later, Tyga ends his engagement to baby mama Blac Chyna two years after welcoming their son, King Cairo.

September 2014: Tyga responds to rumors he’s dating Kylie.

@Tyga Twitter

October 2014: Kylie makes one of her first appearances on Tyga’s Instagram account and the two celebrate Halloween together. Despite this giant step in their relationship, Kris Jenner says, “Kylie isn’t dating anybody.” In an interview with Ryan Seacrest, the momager insists that Kylie’s just hanging out with a “little group of kids who have been around forever.”

November 2014: Tyga reportedly pulls out of an appearance at Greystone Manor in Los Angeles after Kylie is refused entry because 17-year-olds cannot go to clubs in this country. Weeks later, Tyga and Kylie, who are still officially friends at this point, spend Thanksgiving together.

December 2014: Kylie hits three birds with one tweet. This tweet.

in not trying to become a rapper, I'm not getting married, & I'm not pregnant.... — Kylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) December 12, 2014

Tyga and his “friend” Kylie visit a children’s hospital in Los Angeles. The sweet visit, which included meet-and-greets with patients and gifts, later appears on an episode of Tyga’s MTV2 show, Kingin’ With Tyga.

February 7, 2015: Tyga and Kylie spend their first Grammys weekend together by partying with Big Sean, Jennifer Lopez, Chris Brown, Justin Bieber, and others. Here’s the still-unconfirmed couple coupling up at the Grammys after-party with Kendall and Khloé.

February 13, 2015: Drake surprise-drops If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late, which includes the song “6PM in New York.” The lyric “You need to act your age and not your girl’s age” makes everyone think Drizzy is talking about Tyga.

Meanwhile, Amber Rose joins in on the already crowded conversation and also slams Tyga. She tells The Breakfast Club: “[He] should be ashamed of himself. That’s how I feel. For sure....He has a beautiful woman and a baby and left that for a 16-year-old who just turned 17. Like, nah.”

February 16, 2015: Khloé responds to Amber’s comments and defends Kylie on Twitter.

We get asked questions about people all the time and my sisters and I always take the high road and don't answer. Truth is we don't know (1) — Khloé (@khloekardashian) February 16, 2015

these people. I don't know Amber so why would I comment on her. I'm not going to comment on someone I don't know. (2) — Khloé (@khloekardashian) February 16, 2015

Please stop talking about us in interviews mama. None of us talk about you. (3) — Khloé (@khloekardashian) February 16, 2015

February 17, 2015: Tyga denies he’s dating Kylie. Again. He tells The Breakfast Club that he did not “leave my family to be with Kylie. That’s ridiculous.” At this point, the radio program’s ratings presumably quadruple.

February 20, 2015: Kanye West sort of confirms Kyga is a real thing. Consider his response to The Breakfast Club (!) when the topic comes up: “I think that, ugh, I think [Tyga] got in early. I think he was smart.” It would later be revealed that the radio show edited Kanye’s original answer, which was something to the tune of “I think they in love.”

Kylie finally jumps into the whole Amber/Khloé tirade:

“It’s a rare circumstance, so let’s treat this as a special case,” Khloé says.

August 21, 2017: Kylie talks about her breakup from Tyga publicly for the first time.

“There was absolutely not one thing wrong with me and T. He and I will always, always have a bond,” she said on an episode of her E! reality show Life of Kylie.

“There was no crazy fight, we just decided…well, I decided that I’m really young. I don’t want to look back in five years from now and feel like he took something from me when he’s really not that type of person.”

March 28, 2018: As everyone knows at this point, Kylie is pregnant and expecting a baby with Travis! Still, that doesn’t stop some people from speculating about paternity after a fake Snapchat screenshot suggesting Tyga is the father makes the rounds.

Tyga responds to the rumors on Twitter himself.

“I’ve never said anything about someone else’s child or family insinuating my involvement and will never do so,” Tyga says. “Please, stop spreading false stories and attacking people’s families. I have nothing to do with any of that. People should be able to live in peace.”

August 31, 2018: More than a year after their breakup, Tyga puts Kylie on blast during an episode of Nicki Minaj’s Queen Radio show.

When Nicki asks him if he misses Kylie, he says, “No, I’m good. I’m good, love, enjoy.” And when she asks if he put Kylie on the map, he replies, “Big fact. Everybody know that, that’s public,” adding that fans need to look at “the before and after.”

“She always had a platform and she was always destined to be where she was going to be, regardless,” he says. “But when I stepped in and there was a lot of codes being taught, it was like, ‘You could do this. You should start this. You should start doing your hair like this, or you should do this. You should adapt because you need black people to fuck with you ’cause you need culture. If you ain’t got black people behind you, you ain’t got nothing—ain’t nobody going to listen. You can’t influence nobody.’ So I had a lot to do with all that.”

The internet makes everything 100 times more dramatic than what it really is. There was no “2am date with Tyga”. You see me drop two of my friends off at a studio that he happened to be at. — Kylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) October 3, 2019

Travis and i are on great terms and our main focus right now is Stormi ‼️ our friendship and our daughter is priority — Kylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) October 3, 2019
