Fans are speculating Rihanna is pregnant after the Grammys, and it's not OK

All the pregnancy accusations are just as bad as fat shaming, FYI.

theres nothing wrong with Rihanna being pregnant, but its kind of rude to assume it bc shes gained some weight. you wouldnt go up to a heavier set woman and ask when shes due bc it’s disrespectful, so why do it to Rih knowing her weight is already an insecurity of hers?

There's obviously nothing wrong with being pregnant, and if Rihanna truly is carrying a baby, then that's great! However, calling a woman pregnant — or assuming she is because of some kooky signs or because she's covering up her stomach — is body shaming.

Also, just because Rihanna wore an outfit that covered her midsection doesn't automatically confirm a pregnancy. No one is entitled to her body, and she can cover it up should she want to.
