Angelina Jolie desperate for reconciliation with Pitt–and the feeling’s not mutual

Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie is reportedly desperate for reconciliation with Brad Pitt after the couple announced their separation a year ago. However, according to sources, Pitt is not keen on getting back together with the Salt actress.

According to a report in a leading American magazine, the Wanted actress desperately wants Brad Pitt back again after the actor has sobered up and matured since their separation.

“She’s been in tears over losing him. “She’s told friends, ‘I made the mistake of a lifetime,'” said the source to the magazine.

However, according to the same source, the feeling is not shared by Pitt who can’t seem to trust her and thinks she has tormented him for far too long.

“Brad feels too much damage has been done and she’s tormented him for too long to consider taking her back,” said the source.
