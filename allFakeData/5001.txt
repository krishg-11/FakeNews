The American Idol Reboot Is in Jeopardy of Being Canceled

The show might not go on after all! The American Idol reboot is in jeopardy of being canceled because ratings aren’t exactly what the network had hoped for. A source exclusively told In Touch, “Many believe it has to do with the sexual misconduct allegations against Ryan Seacrest.”

Ryan has vehemently denied the accusations against him made by a former stylist who claimed that he would grind his erect penis against her while in his underwear, groped her, and slapped her buttocks. He has since been cleared by NBC, yet his reputation still seems to be a bit tarnished.

And Ryan is not the only one contributing to the show’s questionable future. Celebrity judge Katy Perry — who was paid $25 million for the gig — has also been a big factor as “her flirty behavior with contestants is a turnoff and key element of the ratings decline.”

The “Firework” singer recently planted a smooch on the hopeful contestant, Benjamin Glaze, who had never been kissed before. The source said that particular kiss, “was met with disapproval.” He publicly spoke about the incident with The New York Times and said, “I was a tad bit uncomfortable. I wanted to save it for my first relationship. I wanted it to be special.” Aside from the Katy drama, the source revealed that the other two judges — Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan — are just “bland.”

So what’s in store for the singing competition? The source said, “There are already whispers of a cancellation or a shake-up in the judging panel. Everyone is panicking because the rebooted Idol just isn’t the lightning-rod hit ABC thought it would be.” The reboot premiered on March 11 and lost 3 million viewers by March 19.
