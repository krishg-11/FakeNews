Rob Kardashian and Jennifer Lawrence are dating

Rob hasn't had the easiest time, especially not compared to his sisters.

He has struggled with mental health, weight, and not to mention that entire mess that was his relationship with Blac Chyna.

So now, Kris is working her magic on setting him up with not only the biggest Kardashian stan, but hot movie star, Jennifer Lawrence. AND IT'S WORKING.

According to OK Magazine, the two met in passing, and Jen thought he was "sort of cute."

"So when Kris approached her about taking Rob out, Jen figured, 'Why not?'" an insider said to the mag. "After a few long phone calls and coffee dates and lunches, Jen is pleasantly surprised!"

Naturally, Rob is "totally smitten" with Jen.

"He's always gone for the bad girls, so Jen is a complete breath of fresh air," the insider revealed.

Rob has been turning his life around recently, with a dramatic weight transformation and completely cutting Chyna out of his life so he can be a good dad to baby Dream. Maybe the best thing for him would be Jen?

As for her, she hasn't officially been with anybody since dating Darren Aronofsky.
