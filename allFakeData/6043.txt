Life & Style further claims William and Kate 'want the twins to be seen as individuals.' A palace insider told the publication: 'They don't plan to coordinate the girls' names to rhyme or start with the same letter'.

The US report further reveals that Kate is desperate to name one of the twins Diana, which William is reportedly 'thrilled' about.

The palace is reportedly gearing up for the arrival of two new royal bubs, with the duchess planning to give birth at Kensington Palace in just under two months.

'She's decided she'd like to give birth at Kensington Palace,' a palace insider told Life & Style. 'Kate has been advised to go on bed rest now that she's around the seven-month mark.'

The palace has yet to respond to Life & Style's report.
