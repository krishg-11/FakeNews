Selena Gomez and The Weeknd Are Already in Trouble (EXCLUSIVE)

Looks like things have already taken a turn for Selena Gomez and The Weeknd.

Just weeks after the duo went public with their relationship, they’ve seemed to have run into some troubles already.

“The Weeknd is starting to feel suffocated by Selena,” an insider tells In Touch exclusively. “He’s set to kick off his Starboy: Legend of the Fall 2017 world tour [on Feb. 17 in Sweden], and Selena is begging to join him. He likes her, but he feels like she’s moving way too quickly.”

And apparently, her insecurities are to blame for her neediness.

“Selena’s paranoid that fans will be throwing themselves at the Weeknd and he’ll be tempted to stray,” the insider adds. “She’s so scared that she’s threatened to dump him if he doesn’t let her come along on tour.”

Unfortunately for the new couple, a breakup may be the best possible outcome.

The insider explains, “Selena’s acting so crazy that he’s starting to have second thoughts about their relationship. Friends are concerned that it’s only a matter of time before it all ends in tears due to Selena’s self-sabotaging ways.”
