The real reason Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux split

In news that shocked the world and left pretty much all of us believing that love is dead, Hollywood power couple Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux announced that their marriage was ending in February 2018. The estranged duo issued a joint statement to the The Associated Press that said, in part: "Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else's fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another."

The superstars didn't have much more to say about the matter publicly, though Theroux did crack the door open a bit later that year. However, questions abound about the dynamics between the pair. Aniston and Theroux reportedly got together in 2011, got engaged in 2012, and got married in 2015. Everything seemed peachy keen from the outside, so what the heck happened to this seemingly happy husband and wife? Let's explore some of the potential reasons these two went their separate ways.
