The 47-year-old actor has said he plans to give up on movies in just three years’ time, when he turns 50.

Pitt dropped the bombshell whilst speaking to Australian television show 60 Minutes to promote his latest film, Moneyball.

When asked what he might do next, he replied: “Hell if I know.”

However, the actor hinted that he may continue to work in film behind the camera as a producer “getting stories to the plate that may have had a harder time otherwise.”

Pitt’s acting career began in 1987, although it was for his performance in the 1991 road movie, Thelma and Louise, that he first gained widespread attention. In the ensuing 20 years he has appeared in a host of high-profile Hollywood productions, including Interview with a Vampire, 12 Monkeys, Fight Club and the Ocean’s trilogy.
