Rumor Bust! Robert Pattinson Wasn’t Invited to Royal Wedding

Robert Pattinson wasn’t a no-show at the royal wedding... because he was never invited.

An article claimed that the actor received a coveted invite to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s nuptials, but didn’t attend.

Although Robert and Meghan did work together on the film “Remember Me,” he wasn’t on the guest list and a source close to Pattinson told Gossip Cop he laughed off the reports.
