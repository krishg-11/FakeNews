Notable moments from Trump's State of the Union address

President Trump tried to strike an upbeat tone Tuesday night for his first State of the Union address, but he still drew strong reactions from celebrities on Twitter.

Most stars reacted with a mixture of anger, ridicule, skepticism and sarcasm.

"This 2 hour live broadcast of the new Purge film on all of network TV is very bold," Josh Gad mocked.

Late-night comedians teed up their jokes early. Jimmy Kimmel watched the speech with Stormy Daniels, the adult film star who was reportedly paid to keep quiet about an alleged affair with Trump. She was a guest later on his show "Jimmy Kimmel Live!"

Stephen Colbert also tweeted during the speech.

Some celebrities praised Trump's speech, however.

Conservative commentator Ann Coulter said it was "beautifully delivered," while Chuck Woolery said it was filled with "new hope."

Other celebrities, such as Elizabeth Banks, tried to watch the speech but couldn't make it all the way through.

Some stars didn't even bother.
