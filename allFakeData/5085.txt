Nina Dobrev and Orlando Bloom Are "Casually Dating"

It looks like Nina Dobrev’s relationship status might change again!

The 28-year-old Vampire Diaries star was recently spotted spending time with a newly single Orlando Bloom. Nina and Orlando have been romantically linked multiple times in the past — and according to sources, they’re “having fun together.”

“They’ve known each other for a while,” a source told People magazine. “Recently they’ve been hanging out as more than friends. It’s super casual.”

But Nina’s rep denies that there’s anything romantic going on between the two actors. “Nina and Orlando are just friends. They have the same representation and friends in common, and often end up in the same social group. That’s all it is.”

This isn’t the first time Nina and Orlando sparked dating rumors. In 2014, the two were spotted making out and dancing at a Comic-Con party. After the event, a source close to Nina explained that their connection wasn’t new and that she had an interest in the Pirates of the Caribbean star.

“Nina has known Orlando for a few years now,” the insider revealed. “She’s been out with him in social settings with mutual friends. She’s always thought he was an attractive man.”

Looks like their friendship might turn into something more! Last month, Orlando split from Katy Perry after 14 months of dating. Nina dated her Vampire Diaries co-star Ian Somerhalder for three years before calling it quits in 2013.

Will this be the moment they take their relationship to the next level, or will they fizzle out? We’ll have to wait and see, but we do know they’d make an adorable couple!
