IN THE NEWS The passing on Thursday of former Fox News chairman and CEO Roger Ailes, a TV news pioneer and player in Republican politics who founded FNC in 1996 and resigned in the wake of sexual harassment allegations last summer, prompted a wide range of responses. Said Rupert Murdoch, executive chairman of 21st Century Fox, “ A brilliant broadcaster, Roger played a huge role in shaping America’s media over the last thirty years.” Weighed in Slate, “We live in the world Roger Ailes broke.” Offered MSNBC’s Joy Reid via Twitter, “So Roger Ailes has died. Lots to unpack in that obit.” Ailes, who was 77, died from complications of a fall in his home. A ticker outside the news net’s midtown Manhattan office said yesterday, “A giant passes.” Saturday Night Live will have to find a new Drunk Uncle. With his comedy, Me, Myself & I, picked up by CBS, SNL staple Bobby Moynihan is leaving the NBC sketch show after 9 seasons. Season finale airs tomorrow. The FCC is proposing to do away with the main studio rule, requiring each TV station to have a main studio near its local community. The idea behind the rule, adopted over 70 years ago, was to keep stations accessible to the community, before modern technology made such communication easier. “Broadcasters have shown that the main studio rule is a continuous cost that keeps them from serving their local communities in meaningful ways, like broadcasting additional local programming,” said FCC chairman Ajit Pai on Thursday. “Today’s notice is an important step toward bringing the FCC’s media rules into the digital age.” Instead of spending money on a “for your consideration” Emmy push, the creative team behind CBS comedy Mom is making a $250,000 donation to launch a public support campaign for political target Planned Parenthood. Series star Allison Janney and co-creator/EP Chuck Lorre broke the news on CBS This Morning yesterday. Bobby Moynihan’s leaving Saturday Night Live after 9 seasons. Which SNL alum do you miss most?
