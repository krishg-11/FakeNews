Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie split in 2016 and are engaged in a custody battle for children. Angelina is now determined to expose details of the infamous fight that led to their separation in 2016.

Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie split in 2016 and are engaged in a custody battle for children - Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 9. Recently, a judge handed out a new schedule ordering Angeline Jolie to give Brad Pitt more time with the kids. Brad is allowed to meet his children without Angelina's permission as it was stated that, "the children not having a relationship with their father is harmful to them." The court even stated that the actress could risk losing primary custody of the children if she didn’t follow the order.

This decision has left Angelina fuming, as per a report in Radar Online. Angelina is now determined to expose details of the infamous fight that led to their separation in 2016.

“Angie’s going to paint her life with Brad as a living hell. She’s told friends she’s kept a vivid account of Brad’s boozing, violent rages and volatile behavior. The way things are shaping up, she’ll have no option but to pull out the diary if she wants to win this custody battle,” a source told Radar Online.

“Nobody outside the family, the flight crew and the feds know what went down, but Angie will make it known in her journal. Angie has said the diary will be very damaging to Brad’s custody hopes. She’s calling it her trump card,” the insider revealed.

Angelina Jolie is living with her kids in London currently where she is filming Maleficent 2.
