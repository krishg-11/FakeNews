Skinny Angie Sick Again!

Scary - Skinny Angie Sick Again!

WALKING SKELETON needs sweater to stay warm in summer!

AFTER bouncing back from the brink of death, Angelina Jolie has suffered a dramatic relapse — and wasted away to a life threatening 78 pounds!

“Angie looks as bad as she ever has!” cried a stunned pal of the frail and withered 42-year-old Oscar winner.

Barely two months after The National ENQUIRER revealed Angie had undergone rejuvenating “live cell” replacement procedures at a European clinic, new photos show her sporting spindly, veiny arms!

“She looks like she’s lost more than 10 pounds in just seven days,” said a horrified pal of the “Maleficent” star.

One medical expert is convinced Angie’s condition is once again serious!

“She looks cachectic, pale and exhausted,” weight loss expert Dr. Stuart Fischer, who has not treated Angie, told The ENQUIRER.

Cachexia, or “wasting syndrome,” comes with a loss of weight, muscle atrophy, fatigue, weakness and significant loss of appetite.
