Kris Jenner upset with Kendall Jenner for dating A$AP Rocky over Harry Styles

Kris Jenner is reportedly unhappy with Kendall Jenner and A$AP Rocky's relationship. The Kardashian matriarch was hoping her model daughter would date British heartthrob Harry Styles.

The Victoria's Secret model and rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, had showed off their relationship to the world at the 2017 Met Gala. A source told Hollywood Life: "Kris doesn't understand why Kendall didn't take her relationship with Harry more seriously. She feels like Kendall threw in the towel too quickly and that if she had persevered, she and Harry would still be an item."

"Kris is disappointed that Harry is now off the market and dating Tess. Kris would much rather see her daughter with an A-list celeb like Harry, than A$AP [Rocky] who is now embroiled in baby mama rumors."

"She just doesn't get what Kendall sees in him. She would be thrilled if Kendall was linked to Harry. A new album, a movie, a great reputation, gorgeous, he has it all," the insider added.

Meanwhile, during an interview with ET, the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star said she feels the world is extremely interested in her personal life. She said: "It's not always easy, but I don't know, I just like to keep my private life private. I try my best, but at the same time, I try not to let being out with someone affect my everyday life. Like, if I want to go out and grab a smoothie with a friend who's a male, I'm not gonna let the paparazzi stop me from doing that and living my life and just being a normal person.

"I try to keep things as private as I can, but when it comes to a point, it's just not a big deal," she added.
