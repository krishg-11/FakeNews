Everything That Has Gone Down Since the Brad Pitt Angelina Jolie Divorce Was Announced

Brad Pitt accused of child abuse following an altercation with 15-year-old Maddox



The most plausible cause for the Jolie-Pitt marriage break-down is also the saddest. New reports suggest an altercation between Brad and his 15-year-old son Maddox while Pitt was intoxicated on a 12-hour flight on the family's private jet caused the split. Pitt has since been investigated by the FBI for child abuse (as the altercation happened while the family were in the air) after an anonymous third party called child protection services once the flight landed.



Two members of the Jolie-Pitt staff spoke to The Sun about the incident, denying rumours that Pitt physically hit Maddox, but stating that the fight "started on the way to the airport before the plane took off and escalated on the plane". The incident happened on September 14th and Jolie cited the pair's separation date as being September 15th in her divorce paperwork. According to reports Brad has not seen the children since the incident, and is "distraught and terrified."
