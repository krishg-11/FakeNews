Jennifer Garner Denounces People Magazine Cover Story About Divorce

Jennifer Garner can let those pesky pregnancy rumors go, but when it comes to misleading news stories about her divorce, she’s not here for it.

The typically private actress took to her Facebook page Wednesday afternoon to “set the record straight” on a cover story People magazine ran in its new issue. The article, titled “Life After Heartbreak,” seemingly presents itself as an interview with Garner, but instead references insiders and sources who claim her split with Ben Affleck has “been the most difficult decision for her.”

Another insists Garner will “eventually” start dating again. “She’s certainly not jumping up and down and screaming, ‘I’m single!’ and planning dates,” the source says. “She still says Ben was the love of her life.”

Garner was quick to respond to the story, writing in a statement, “I did not pose for this cover. I did not participate in or authorize this article.”

The 45-year-old adds that although this “isn’t a tragedy by any measure” it does affect herself and her young children with Affleck ― Violet, Seraphina and Samuel.

“While we are here, for what it’s worth: I have three wonderful kids and my family is complete,” she joked of those frequent pregnancy reports.

Garner and Affleck initially separated in June 2015 after 10 years of marriage. Although there were rumors of reconciliation over the last year, the pair officially filed for divorce in April.
