The Daily Mail publishes apology to Sir Elton John for misleading public

Britain's Daily Mail newspaper has published a public apology to music icon Sir Elton John for insinuating in a previous article that he had "misled people about his reasons" for cancelling a charity concert only to perform live in London a few nights later.

The piece, according to its timestamp, was published at midnight and reads:

"A recent article, ‘£3.5m wedding singers’, said that Sir Elton John had cancelled a charity gig in Dubai for medical reasons yet had performed at a lucrative private event in London a few days after the announcement. In fact, the Dubai concert at the Autism Rocks arena was not a charity event but part of Sir Elton’s Wonderful Crazy Night Tour. It was cancelled on doctor’s orders because of an unavoidable medical procedure which prevented international travel. We did not intend to suggest that he had misled people about his reasons for the cancellation. We apologise for any such impression and have agreed a payment to charity and costs."
