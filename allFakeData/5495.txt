Kris Jenner and Corey Gamble Are Calling It Quits (EXCLUSIVE)

Kris Jenner and boyfriend Corey Gamble‘s three-year romance has come to an end. Despite their 25-year age difference — she’s 61 and he’s 36 — the #ProudMama is moving on. “Kris is ready to call it quits with Corey,” a source told In Touch exclusively. “You can hear it in her voice that she is done.” Watch the video below for more details.

Kim Kardashian has since confirmed her mother’s breakup on Instagram. She shared a picture of her mom sporting blonde hair and wrote, “Caption this… Mine is [single white female].”

It’s no wonder Kris and Corey headed to Splitsville, after all, the Kardashian/Jenner matriarch certainly has her hands full — she’s reportedly expecting three grandbabies in early 2018. Sisters Kylie Jenner, Khloé Kardashian, and Kim are all preggo — and are all having baby daddy drama, too. Kylie, 20, — who is about five months along and recently sported her baby bump on Snapchat — is expecting with boyfriend Travis Scott. Meanwhile, Khloé, 33, is pregnant with her first child with her boyfriend, NBA player Tristan Thompson, 26, while Kim, 37, and husband Kanye West, 40, are expecting baby No. 3 this winter via surrogate. From lack of commitment and disinterest to selfish behavior and different priorities, all three sisters are struggling to accept the truth, multiple insiders told In Touch exclusively.

“The arrival of three babies should be an exciting time for the sisters,” said the Kardashian insider. “Instead, their love lives are all in tatters.” But don’t worry, mama Kris will be there for her girls. “Kris Jenner has assured her girls that everything will be OK. Whatever happens, the family will be there to support them.”
