How much are actors on Saturday Night Live paid per episode?

SNL castmembers don’t make as much as you would think. I have worked with talent agencies that rep SNL castmembers. Most castmembers are making between $2,500 and $10,000 per week, roughly, for the 22-week-long (or so) season. Other answers referring to Jay Mohr and Will Ferrell are accurate.

What’s crazy though… Creator/Executive Producer Lorne Michaels has a net worth of $350 million for creating a sketch TV show, which showcases talent who write and perform sketch comedy (without Lorne), making about $60,000-$225,000/season to do so. SNL sucks now compared to its glory days (which, for me, were the late 90’s and early 2000’s), so I don’t lose sleep over it.

On another note, I miss the days where you could watch an episode of SNL without having to be beat over the head with political jokes. Heck, I miss the days where you could turn on any television channel without hearing about politics. And just like that, I have brought up politics in a non-political space. Damn!
