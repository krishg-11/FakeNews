Oscar wins, stardom and rehab: Elle Fanning and 31 other child stars - then and now

Dakota Fanning

Then: Fanning made her big screen debut at the tender age of just eight, in 2011, and went on to become one of America’s best known child actresses, acting alongside Tom Cruise in War of the Worlds (2005), and Julia Roberts in Charlotte’s Web (2006). Unlike many youthful stars, however, she also successfully transitioned into being a teen actress, with a high profile role as villainous vampire Jane in the Twilight movies.

Now: Fanning, who is now 22, is combining work as an actress with a modelling career, and pursuing a degree at New York University. Her 18-year-old sister, Elle Fanning, is also an actress.
