Angelina Jolie: Meet my new man

According to reports, Ange’s new man – rapper and filmmaker praCh ly has been making secret visits to her Hollywood home, where he has bonded with the 42 year old’s son, Maddox and is even teaching the family about Buddism.



“Angelina and praCh have a special bond. They’re perfect for each other,” an insider revealed to National Enquirer.



A further source added, “PraCh is a great role model for Maddox. He can teach him about his homeland of Cambodia in a way he can relate to.”

“That’s because both Maddox and praCh were born in Camodia, but didn’t grow up there.”



Ange and paCh, 38 - who has been dubbed the “first Cambodian rap star” - were first introduced by mutual friend Loung Ung, the Cambodian-American activist who wrote the memoir First They Killed My Father, which Ange recently adapted into a film.



And sources say the pair are a perfect match, spending hours talking Cambodian politics and charity opportunities.







“If you look at them together, Angie is clearly smitten.



“She hasn’t looked this happy in a long time – or since the break up with Brad more than a year ago.”
