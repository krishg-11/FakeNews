9 Years, Stop It: The Craziest Rumors About Beyoncé and Jay Z Over the Years

Even before tying the knot with a private wedding in 2008, Beyoncé and Jay Z have long been #RelationshipGoals.

Despite being among music’s most respected and iconic artists, influencers and, ultimately, power couples, one of their most admirable qualities has been keeping their personal business in the background while still standing at the forefront of elite stardom. The rightfully glorified relationship between the Houston starlet and New York rap heavyweight, blooming from over a decade ago, has since gracefully passed the test of time and birthed a beautiful baby girl, Blue Ivy Carter, and soon-to-be twins of the Carter family.

But even the most idolized of relationships trail obstacle-ridden roads. And though the Carters have obviously withstood them, it never stopped the rumor mills from spinning with attempts to creep into their private life. Namely, cheating scandals, pregnancy hoaxes and whispers of divorce have been abundant among the public, of which Bey and Jay may thinly address via lyricism — if the chatterboxes are lucky enough.

On their anniversary day of April 4, the day that the couple marks another successful year as Mr. and Mrs. Carter, we celebrate the unbreakable, unshakable, undeniable forces of Black love the Carter way.

See our fool-proof list of nine most-foolish rumors making their way through grapevines over the years but, fortunately, never between the Carters.
