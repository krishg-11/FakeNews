MTO SHOCKER: Jennifer Lopez Appeared To Hurt HER BACK . . . Trying To Dance Like CIARA . . . Watch The 47 Year Old . . . Get INJURED!!! (Pics)

Jennifer Lopez was not taken to a hospital last night, despite our earlier reports. While the below images appear to show the 47 yer old singer suffered a back injury, it's not what it seems.

Jennifer does a part in her Vegas act where she pretends she is tired and hurt then she races across the stage and does a dramatic knee slide.

We confirmed that J Lo is fine, she was seen dancing and having fun at the after party.
