Mary J. Blige Hacked, Did Not Write Kendu Isaacs Hate Tweet

Mary J. Blige says she was hacked and was not the person who tweeted a hateful message about estranged husband, Martin “Kendu” Isaacs. Gossip Cop can help set the record straight.

On Sunday morning, a tweet appeared on Blige’s feed stating, “F*ck Kendu Isaacs I f*cking hate him and his whole family. I unfollowed him on IG & ALL of my fans need 2. #StrengthOfAWoman 4/28 #DuDeadDay.” But the missive was deleted, and Blige is now insisting she is not the person who wrote it.

“Hey guys. I was hacked with that message about Kendu. I dont hate him & his family. Nor do I wish death on him. I just want this 2 B over,” Blige said. “This,” of course, is the spouses’ unsettled divorce. As Gossip Cop reported, Blige filed for divorce from Isaacs, her husband and manager, last July. The couple split after 12 years of marriage.
