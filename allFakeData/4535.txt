Rihanna Is Reportedly "Hurt" Over Drake's Obsession With Nicki Minaj!

Apparently, Rihanna is no longer the only girl in Drake‘s world! The “We Found Love” singer is reportedly “hurt” by the fact that the “Fake Love” rapper’s anaconda seems to be pointing in Nicki Minaj‘s direction these days. We guess RiRi still has feelings for her ex and longtime friend after all.

“Things didn’t end well when she and Drake broke up last year,” a source told Hollywood Life. “She still has strong feelings over it. Seeing him with Nicki hurts, but she always felt like he was obsessed with her. Their connection comes as no surprise to Rihanna.”

The Canadian has never tried to hide the fact that his feelings for Nicki go past “just friends.” Then again, Drake did make it very clear (to the entire world) how he views Rihanna during his 2016 VMAs speech.

“She’s someone I’ve been in love with since I was 22 years old,” Drake admitted at the awards show. “She’s one of my best friends in the world. All my adult life, I’ve looked up to her, even though she’s younger than me.”

Has that love changed? Or is the rapper’s heart suddenly large enough for two women? “[Rihanna] definitely has no plans to get back together with Drake,” the source continued. “As far as she’s concerned, Nicki can have him. In fact, she thinks they should go ahead and make it official.”

The timing for this new romance couldn’t be better since, apparently, Drake is looking for a wifey. “Drake does want to settle down and have kids one day, and he’s confident that the right woman will come along at the right time,” a source previously revealed. Is Nicki that woman? There’s no denying they’d make one hell of a couple!
