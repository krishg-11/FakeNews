‘Mystery Woman’ Inexplicably Dubbing Gloria’s Lines In Spanish Modern Family

Colombia native and Modern Family star Sofia Vergara says she has no clue why she wasn’t asked to dub the lines of her character Gloria on the Latin American version of the show. And her supporters back home aren’t too happy, either. “Friends and family called to tell me, ‘We really don’t like it. We know it’s not you – and that woman sounds horrible,’” Vergara told the Hollywood Reporter. Meanwhile, the identity of this vocal artist with the “horrible” voice remains a mystery - and 20th Century Fox Television did not return inquiring phone calls. Someone should just ask Manny who she is; haven’t we learned by now there’s nothing that kid doesn’t know? [HR]
