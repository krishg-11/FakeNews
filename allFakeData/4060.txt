Here’s Why Kendall Jenner Is Not Planning On Becoming A Mom Like Her Sisters Anytime Soon

Even though Kendall Jenner seems to be the only in the family without a child or a baby on its way, apparently, she doesn’t feel left out at all! On the contrary, Kendall thinks she’s lucky to not be a mother just yet.

That being said, she supposedly loves being an aunt to all of her sisters’ kids, but for now, that is the closest she wants to get to motherhood.

Kendall thinks she’s still way too young to be a mom and loves the freedom.

‘Kendall does not feel left out at all about being the only Kardashian-Jenner sister who won’t have a child. As far as she is concerned, she is more than happy to be the coolest aunt who spoils her nieces and nephews and gives them back to their mommies. She is not the odd woman out, that is for sure.’

It’s not like she doesn’t like kids – in fact, she is very fond of them, especially her sisters’ little ones, but she values her free time way too much to become responsible for another life at her age.

‘Kendall can do whatever she wants and is not limited to having to care for a baby. Whenever she feels she is ready to write that chapter of her life, she will see what happens. But at the moment, Kendall’s having a ball with her boy toy Blake Griffin. And seeing as Blake has two beautiful children already, she does not see him pushing for more kids in the near future either,’ our insider stated.
