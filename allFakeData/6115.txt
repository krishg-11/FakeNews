Janet Jackson Called Police on Ex Wissam Al Mana to Check Welfare of Their Baby Son

This divorce is getting ugly. Janet Jackson is a mom to a one-year-old baby son, Eissa, and while he was with his father and her estranged ex-husband Wissam Al Mana on Saturday night at the Nobu hotel in Malibu, she reportedly called the police from to check on the welfare of her little boy.

“Deputies were there [and] called to the scene. They decided the child was okay and they left,” a Malibu Lost Hill’s Sheriff’s Station spokesperson told People.

Entertainment Tonight also spoke to Janet’s brother Randy Jackson who revealed the pop star decided to call 9-1-1 after the nanny (who was helping Wissam babysit) called her worried about Wissam’s aggressive behavior. “[She was] terrified by his behavior and locked herself in a bathroom, so she could contact Janet,” he told the news outlet.

Janet and Wissam previously married in 2012 and split in April 2017, just three months after Eissa was born in January 2017. “I just want to keep it real for you guys for a second — yes I separated from my husband. We are in court and the rest is in God’s hands,” Janet told her concerned fans at the time. It was subsequently reported that Janet felt like a “prisoner” in her own marriage. “She thought he had become too controlling during the pregnancy and she had already allowed him to dictate her appearance and even the way she performed at concerts,” a source told Page Six.

Now, Janet is allegedly dating her ex-boyfriend Jermaine Dupri, whom she previously dated from 2002 until 2009. “Janet’s taking it slowly, but yes, she and Jermaine are dating,” an insider recently In Touch. “She’s comfortable with him. They know everything about each other, and she’s happier than ever.” We’re just glad Eissa is okay!
