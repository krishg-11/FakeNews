A court has warned Angelina Jolie that she could lose custody of the kids if she doesn't allow ex-husband Brad Pitt access, according to reports.

In court documents obtained by People, a judge reportedly tells Angelina that limiting the time Brad gets to spend with Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and nine-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne is 'harmful' to the kids.

Furthermore, she has apparently been told to help 'repair' the relationship and speak with the children and their doctors to assure them, "they are safe with their father.”

"It is critical that each of [the six] children have a healthy and strong relationship with their father and mother,” the documents say, according to the website.

Angelina must reportedly also give Brad the mobile phone number of each child and allow him to call whenever he wants without snooping in on their calls or texts.

A schedule has been put in place, claims People, to allow Brad sufficient access over the summer.

Warning Angelina that she was risking her position as the primary caregiver, the judge is said to have warned, “If the minor children remain closed down to their father and depending on the circumstances surrounding this condition, it may result in a reduction of the time they spend with [Jolie] and may result in the Court ordering primary physical custody to [Pitt].”

Mirror Online has contacted reps of the pair for comment.
