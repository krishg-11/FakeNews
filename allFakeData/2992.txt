Friends fears for Jessica Simpson

JESSICA Simpson's friend are worried that the Newlyweds star will spiral into depression following the death of her beloved pooch, Daisy.

After losing her beloved Maltipoo Daisy to a coyote attack, Jessica Simpson may be at the lowest point of her life, friends fear.

"Daisy was her baby," one of them tells PEOPLE. "It's going to put her into a tailspin. It will put her into the worst place ever."

Daisy was perhaps one of the most pampered pets in Hollywood, report People.

Simpson fed Daisy steak, not dog food, and referred to herself as "Daisy's Mommy." When leaving the house, Simpson left on the air-conditioning for her dog; and when Daisy was sick, Simpson refused visitors so that they wouldn't wake Daisy. She threw Daisy birthday parties, and when she talked about having a "girls' night in" with a video, she was talking about herself and Daisy.

"Jessica has a very small inner circle," the friend said. "But she always had Daisy. Daisy gave her unconditional love."

And, unlike some of the men in her life, the friend added, "Daisy never betrayed her. Daisy was always there for her. This is serious. Jessica’s heart is broken."

Whenever she was out at night, Simpson called home and had "someone put Daisy on the phone so she could say goodnight."

"Daisy ran the household," the friend said. "If Daisy didn’t like you, you were gone. Sometimes if her regular hair and makeup people weren’t available and Jessica had a sit-in, if Daisy didn’t like them, they wouldn’t be back. Daisy ran the roost."

When Simpson was having relationship problems, "she would cry herself to sleep at night, using Daisy as a pillow."
