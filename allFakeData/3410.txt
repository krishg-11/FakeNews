Heidi Klum's Bikini Body Takes A Lot Of Work & Her Boyfriend Is Over Hearing About It

A source tells OK! exclusively, “Heidi has nothing to talk about except her workout routine, how she avoids carbs, the tricks her private chef or personal trainer are implementing…it’s so tedious for everyone in her life, including Vito Schnabel and a big reason why he needs a break so often.” Ouch.

Heidi, 44, looks like a fountain of youth but it obviously takes more of an effort than we knew. But her loved one are over her ramming her perfection down their throats.

Adds the insider, “What also really annoys people is how Heidi fakes being normal. She even pretends to eat junk food when the cameras are on her but she hasn’t actually swallowed a bite of a burger in years.”

Just last month, she and her boyfriend spent time in Italy, so we really have no idea how she avoided the pasta and pizza!

“All she talks about is working out and what she’s eaten that day – which is usually not much more than a handful of nuts and steamed kale.” That doesn’t sound like fun.
