Sarah Jessica Parker: A baby at 52!

The exciting news comes as the actress’ former surrogate Michelle Ross – who gave birth to SJP and her husband Matthew Broderick’s twins Marion and Tabitha in 2009 – revealed she is once again preparing to be a surrogate.

‘When you are having your first visit with a new Dr and he’s crazy excited that you were a surrogate three times... And even more excited when you mention doing it one more time in a year or so,’ posted Michelle on Facebook.

‘And he complimented my uterus, so he’s a keeper. Only a surrogate knows the excited joy of hearing: “You have a perfect uterus.”’

If Michelle were to successfully deliver another child for SJP, it would make the 52-year-old actress one of the oldest celebrity women to welcome a new baby.
