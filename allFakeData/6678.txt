Brad Pitt Going Back To School To Impress Professor Girlfriend, Neri Oxman! Actor's new love has 'no intention' of moving to Hollywood.

Brad Pitt is going back to school for new leading lady, Neri Oxman!

“Neri is beautiful and smart. She is a professor and has no intention of giving up her studies and teaching and move to Hollywood,” a source told Naughty Gossip.

As RadarOnline.com readers know, the actor has been getting serious with the rockstar MIT professor, and basically lives with her now that he flies to Boston often.

They were introduced earlier this year when Oxman, 42, helped Pitt, 54, with an architecture project he was working on. Now, the Hollywood hunk thinks she’s the “sexiest woman” he’s “ever met!”

He also reportedly told fans that he thinks she’s too smart for him, and wishes he could impress her!

“Now Brad is finding out why intelligence is so much more sexy than anything,” continued the source, adding that Oxman resembles Amal Clooney in her beauty and brains.

While Pitt is still hashing out the final details of his divorce from Angelina Jolie, it seems he’s more than ready to take the next step with Oxman!
