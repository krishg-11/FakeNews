Kaley Cuoco & Mayim Bialik ‘Hate Each Other!’

Kaley Cuoco and Big Bang Theory co-star Mayim Bialik are at war!

As RadarOnline.com has learned from Naughty Gossip reports, Cuoco and Bialik’s relationship has become so bad that producers try to keep them apart on the set!

“Kaley and Mayim hate each other. There have been huge cat fights between the two of them and now producers try to just keep them apart,” a source told Straight Shuter.

Who knew the on-screen pals were so at odds behind the scenes?

“Mayim is actually very cool and doesn’t understand why Kaley hates her. She has tried several times to make peace but it has never worked. Now she just tries to stay away,” added the insider.

As Radar exclusively reported, the cast of the hit show has had many icy feuds in the past few years of filming. A source recently revealed that the money-hungry actors are extremely jealous of Jim Parsons, as he is the highest-paid – and arguably most beloved – star in the series.

Ten years of Big Bang Theory drama have been exposed as the show wraps up – with Kaley Cuoco and Mayim Bialik’s unfriendly relationship being the latest shocker!
