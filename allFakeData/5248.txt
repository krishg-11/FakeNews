AceShowbiz - %cLamar Odom% is reportedly planning to ruin %cKhloe Kardashian%'s upcoming wedding to %cTristan Thompson%. Lamar is whimpering his regrets about how he treated the "Keeping Up with the Kardashians" star, according to a source.

"He hates how Khloe's finally dating a guy who treats her right. It burns Lamar up because however much he wants to deny, the reality is that he's still in love with her and believes they're soul mates who are destined to be together again," the source tells Radar Online.

Lamar apparently still cannot forget Khloe. The source adds, "He's clinging to this hope that she's still got feelings for him, which of course is ridiculous, and he's even talking about having a face-to-face with her for closure."

Khloe recently gushed over her relationship with Tristan. "I'm in the best relationship I've ever been in and it doesn't take a ring for me to feel that way," she told Daily Mail's YOU magazine, "I believe in marriage and I want to be married again one day but I don't have a time frame. Why do people think that marriage equates to happiness? There are a lot of people in unhealthy marriages."
