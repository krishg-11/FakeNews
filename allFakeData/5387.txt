'I was actually proud of her. I mean, look -- you are getting your back up against a wall with something like that,' he told US Weekly at the Raising The Bar to End Parkinson’s event in Sherman Oaks, California on Saturday.

'What do you expect you know in the long run? But every time I see it, I go, "You go girl!'"

Even though he previously had his reservations about his wife coming on the show, Harry now admits Lisa is doing a good job.

Make-believe: TMZ has reported that Kim Richards invented the fact that she knows a secret about Harry that Lisa is covering up during last week's episode

'Well, you know, I am [proud] because she’s doing a magnificent job,' he said. 'I think she’s bringing some class to a show that is kind of a reflection of who we are today.

'So in some sense it is art in that respect. I think she’s doing an extraordinary job.'

As for the big secret Kim is accusing him of hiding? Harry said he is in the dark just like everyone else.

Losing her cool: When Kim, 50, brought up her husband, Lisa, 51, furiously smashed a glass of wine

'There is a hashtag #WhatDidHarryDo? out there so maybe someone will tell me at some point, and I hope it was good,' he joked.

On last week's episode, Kim, 50, accused Lisa of harboring a secret about her husband, causing Lisa, 51, to throw and smash a glass full of wine.

Fans were left wondering exactly what Kim 'knew' about Harry, 63, but TMZ reports that Kim fabricated the story just to push Lisa’s buttons.

In the face: Lisa tossed a glass full of wine into Kim's face

According to production sources, the Housewives brought up the issue again during the taping of the reunion episode, and Kim admitted she made it up.

The season five reunion episode was filmed on February 20 and will air on a later date.

Fans witnessed the feud between Kim and Lisa come to a dramatic head on Tuesday night's episode.

In a final flourish after a menacing exchange of words, Lisa furiously smashed a wine glass after throwing the contents in Kim's face.

'I f***ing lost my f***ing marbles,' Lisa admitted later.

The astonishing fight came during what should have been a civilized dinner during a trip to Yolanda Foster's hometown of Amsterdam.

But the civility did not last long as they started having a serious chat, with Lisa discussing her 'really deep-rooted issues about people dying from alcohol and drug overdoses' after losing her 21-year-old sister when she was just six.

Breaking down, Lisa turned to Kim and said: 'I'm sorry if I've ever gotten into any of your business, I never meant to …'

'Well, you have,' Kim snapped, shocking everyone by cutting her short in her emotional moment and bringing up their feud on the jet over there.

About to explode: Lisa became outraged after Kim brought up her husband Harry

'I have been sober for three years,' Kim insisted, adding that her one time taking a pill at the poker party was a one off.

'You have gone around to everybody and talked about me,' she said, also pointing to Eileen and saying: 'And you too.

She then unexpectedly turned the tables on Lisa, telling her: 'I'm concerned about you, and your situation at home. You wanna bring out my stuff, let's talk about your home life.'

Dinner fight: Kim's sister Kyle Richards looked downcast as the fight dragged on

As Eileen angrily intervened - telling her 'shame on you' - Kim snapped: 'Shut your f***ing mouth, I've had enough of you you beast.'

As Yolanda tried to calm everyone down, she mentioned about how Lisa was understanding because she has admitted that her husband Harry has only been sober for three years.

'Let's talk about the husband,' Kim said spitefully. 'Let's not talk about what you don't want out.'

Too much drama: Kyle, 46, became upset after watching sister Kim's outburst and its aftermath

That was when Lisa exploded, initially trying to grab Kim's face as she snapped: 'Let me tell you something - don't touch my husband, ever.'

'If you don't want it out for everybody to know, you better watch what you talk about me, or everybody will know,' Kim replied. 'Everybody will know.'

Lisa then stood up, threw the contents of her glass at Kim and then angrily smashed it on the table's edge, screaming as Yolanda held her back: 'You never go near my husband! Don't you f***ing understand that? You never go after my f***ing husband!'

Reflecting on her behaviour: 'I f***ing lost my f***ing marbles,' Lisa admitted later

Later, she asked: 'What the f*** does Kim Richards know - what does she know about Harry? What did he do? She doesn't even know my husband.'

Kim's hatred did not extend just to Lisa and Eileen, 55, - she also attacked her sister Kyle, snidely saying 'go after your new friend' as Kyle, 46, prepared to leave in tears.

'You want me to defend you but your behavior is indefensible!' she sobbed.

Making up: Kim surprised Lisa the next morning by coming to her room to talk things over

Eventually all the women were left huddled together in tears after the ugly fight - with only Brandi Glanville staying with Kim.

Yolanda then went back to them and told Kim: 'That is not the way to communicate. That is not the way to talk. You shouldn't go after her husband or her children.'

'I have been pushed to the limit with this,' Kim insisted.

Street fight: Brandi, 42, later lost her temper while the crew was walking in the street

The other women were most sympathetic to Kyle, with Lisa telling her: 'It's abusive, and if you are in an abusive relationship you walk away from it. You are being abused by Kim.'

Later, Kim explained: 'Alcohol ruled my life. It called all the shots. And it took a heck of a fight to get it back. I'm not gonna let one person go around putting doubt in people's minds.'

'It's so cruel,' Eileen said with tears. 'It's so bizarre to me.'

As the evening ended, Lisa vowed that she will 'never talk' to Kim again. But the next morning, Kim caught her by surprise by coming to her hotel door - and was invited in.

'This is the most important thing in my life, my sobriety,' Kim told her. 'And it's where my children get hurt. I will f***ing kill for my kids.'

'Well that was never my intention,' Lisa insisted. 'I have come at this only with good intentions.'

No memory: Yolanda Foster was reminded by a former flame that they used to date

Amazingly given how the previous evening had ended, Lisa assured Kim that they were 'good'. 'I believe so - I believe we can move forward,' she said.

Eileen admitted she found Lisa's sudden about face 'pretty mind blowing'. 'For all of a sudden everything to be OK, like nothing happened - my brain does not compute,' she said.

But the fighting was far from over.

During a night out at a coffee shop, Brandi, 42, said the last time she smoked weed she had been with Kyle, who was upset at her saying it publicly because she did not want her kids to know.

In her defense: Harry told US Weekly, 'What do you expect you know in the long run? But every time I see it, I go, "You go girl!'"

As they left, Brandi had a meltdown in the street, saying: 'Anyone and everyone can say whatever the f**k they wanna say about me, but I can't say the truth about them, and it's f***ing annoying.

'You guys re the biggest f***ing hypocrites of all f***ing time!' she exploded, walking off screaming out loud.

'Finally we're having a little reprieve from the drama and insanity. But no, here again, walking down the street screaming bloody murder,' Eileen complained later.

But there were lighter moments. When Yolanda took everyone to meet her mother Ans she cracked them all up by saying she had had a 'space cake' at one of the coffee shops, despite Yolanda telling everyone they 'never did it'.

And during a bike-riding trip, they came across a bearded guy at a windmill who insisted he knew Yolanda 'from back then', adding: 'We dated.'

'I am going to blame it on the brain damage because I swear to God I do not remember the guy,' Yolanda, 51, said later.

'And it makes me feel awful! I should remember who I kissed.'

'She was clearly riding a lot of things, it wasn't just bikes,' Lisa Vanderpump quipped.

They also discussed the red light district, with Yolanda admitting: 'If I was dead broke and I had to feed my children, I would do anything - even that.'

Lisa laughed off the excuse, saying it wasn't necessary to resort to the sex trade to feed your children.
