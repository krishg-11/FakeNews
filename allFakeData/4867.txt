Surprise! Katharine McPhee and David Foster Are Engaged

What a difference a year makes! Lovebirds David Foster, 68, and Katharine McPhee, 34, were super coy about their burgeoning relationship in fall 2017, insisting publicly that they were just friends. Now, the songwriter and the singer, who first met when she was fresh off of American Idol at age 21 and he produced her first single, are engaged!

David popped the question while on holiday in Italy, his rep confirmed to TMZ. This will be Katharine's second marriage and David's fifth; his last wife was The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum Yolanda Hadid.

While some sources claimed that they weren't building towards marriage, David's daughter Erin Foster may have known this was going to happen all along â€” "Excited about my new step mom," Erin captioned an Instagram photo of her back in November.

Now, the next question is, will it be a long engagement?
