Rumor Bust! There Is No $760M Prenup for Jennifer Lopez & Alex Rodriguez

Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez are going strong, but they aren’t making plans to walk down the aisle anytime soon.

A report this week claimed that J-Rod want to get married and had started ironing out a $760 million prenup, while adding that she is worth a reported $360 million, and he a reported $400 million. Gossip Cop has learned, however, that the story is bogus. They don’t have any wedding plans, nor are they working on a prenup.

A source close to the situation tells Gossip Cop that the story is “ridiculous.”
