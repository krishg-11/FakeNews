Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone’s Flirting Leaves Eva Mendes “Fed Up” (REPORT)

There is trouble in paradise!

Superstar couple Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes are allegedly on the rocks — and it’s all because of Ryan’s La La Land costar Emma Stone! According to a report from Radar Online, the duo has been feuding over Ryan’s flirtation with his award-winning costar.

The 36-year-old father has been denying all accusations of cheating, though. “Ryan keeps insisting that there’s nothing going on with Emma,” an insider told Radar. “He is hoping that another baby will make Eva see how committed he is to her.”

Eva, who shares daughters Esmeralda, 2, and Amada, 9 months, with Ryan is reportedly “fed up” with their current situation. “She feels like Ryan has turned her into a baby-making machine!”

Amidst all the drama, Ryan did take the time to thank his long-time partner in his Golden Globe acceptance speech. “You don’t get to be up here without standing on the shoulders of a mountain of people and there’s no time to thank everyone,” the heartthrob said. “I just would like to try to thank one person properly and say that while I was singing and dancing and playing piano and having one of the best experiences I’ve ever had on a film, my lady was raising our daughter, pregnant with our second and trying to help her brother fight his battle with cancer…So, sweetheart, thank you.”

Though reports surfaced of a possible secret wedding for the famous parents back in September of 2016, the duo has yet to make any announcement of nuptials.

We’re hoping their long-term relationship, which blossomed back in 2011, isn’t cut short. But, being the private couple that they, we’re not sure we’ll ever know!
