Meghan Markle’s father hits out at Royal Family urging them to ‘BREAK THE SILENCE’

Mr Markle, who turns 74 on Wednesday, said all he cares about is to make peace with his estranged daughter and become part of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s lives.

And to achieve this, he will keep releasing interviews, despite his daughter and her husband, Prince Harry being said to have grown “frustrated” with his continued appearance on the media.

The former lightning and photography director told TMZ: "I was silent for a full year and the press beat me up every day saying I was a hermit hiding in Mexico, so I gave my story.

"Apparently that interview put the Royal Family in their silence mode... so, I gave another interview to break the silence.

“All they have to do is speak to me.”
