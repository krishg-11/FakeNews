â€‹Angelina Jolie Is Secretly Dating a Handsome Older Guy

Angelina Jolie has officially moved on from her relationship with Brad Pittâ€”and she's dating a regular dude (AKA not an actor). More specifically, she's dating a handsome older man who sells homes for a living.

"Brad and Angie are both very secretive about their dating life. Angie has told some friends she isn't ready to date, but she has been seeing a handsome, older-looking man who is a real estate agent," a source tells ET. "He isn't a celebrity or high profile in any way."

The source explains that "Angie was in a very bad place" after splitting from Brad in September 2016, and that "just having another adult to spend time with has been helpful."

Meanwhile, Brad also appears to be dating, and he's also avoiding actors. "He's very private about who heâ€™s seeing, but he does continue to casually date," the source says. "The women he sees are not in the public eye."



By the way, don't get your hopes up about Brad and Angie consciously re-coupling anytime soon because "they can barely be in the same room together." ðŸ‘€
