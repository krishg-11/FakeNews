Is Kris Jenner Dating A Nigerian Billionaire?

Rumors are going around that Kris Jenner is dating a Nigerian billionaire. That being said, it looks like the Keeping Up with the Kardashians momager may have finally dumped 36-year-old Corey Gamble and is now seeing another beau named Christopher Cunningham in secret.

Reportedly, Cunningham is a Nigerian billionaire – heir of his dad’s oil empire.

Other reports are claiming that Jenner is interested in selling in Calabasas and wants to move to Manhattan Beach.

As she copes with the pregnancy news, Kylie Jenner has been relying a lot on her mother’s support and help.

As for the matriarch’s relationship with Gamble, it is safe to say it hasn’t been going well at all considering the two haven’t posted any pics together on social media for over a year.

For the very socially active and open about their private lives Kardashian-Jenners that definitely means something!

In addition, Kris admitted on Ellen’s show that she never planned to walk down the aisle with her much younger man.

But they were spotted out and about in July and August, either having dinner together in a Hollywood hotspot or on a tropical St. Tropez vacation.
