Inside Caitlyn Jenner’s Skin Cancer Nightmare – Check Out The Disturbing Pics!

Caitlyn Jenner took to social media to show her fans a huge disturbing scab on her nose that she claims was sun damage from decades ago! However, we have learned that it might actually be something much more serious.

One insider close to the transgender icon told us that ‘Caitlyn’s biggest fear’s that she’ll lose her nose.’

Apparently, Caitlyn is afraid that the damage ’hs spread’ and the doctors will need to cut the dead tissue off again.

‘She has been having a breakdown about it. With all of her plastic surgeries on her nose over the years, there is not much there, to begin with!’ the source added, explaining that she is really scared of losing her nose.

Our snitch also claims that Cait has been using her health problem to guilt trip her family into sending a lot more time with her.

Other sources stated that she was ‘going overboard about dying.’

‘She is taking desperate measures and calling everyone about needing to spend time with her because she does not know what is going to happen with her health.’

However, that did not stop Jenner from joking about the terrible situation around her friends, making light of the danger.

‘While I am under, maybe they can give me another boob job while they’re at it,’ she apparently told some of her pals.

As you may know already, the Jenner confessed back in 2013 that because skin cancer was detected, the medical specialists took a chunk of tissue from her nose.

Seeing how horrible it looks now, it is hard to believe it is merely sun damage. Has the cancer returned?
