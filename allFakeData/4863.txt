Anna Wintour Net Worth

The current editor in chief of Vogue magazine, Anna Wintour, has a net worth of $35 million. In addition to her net worth, she has a highly coveted position in the world of magazine publishing. She has also served as the (albeit not very flattering) inspiration for the popular novel and movie The Devil Wears Prada. Her career began in the world of fashion before moving into journalism, largely at the behest of her parents. In the year 1970, Wintour was hired on as an editorial assistant for the new Harper's & Queen fashion magazine. Even at this early stage of her career, Wintour divulged to coworkers that she had the desire to edit Vogue, a desire that would grow to be fulfilled nearly 20 years later. Wintour introduced sweeping changes to Vogue from her first issue forward. Many of these changes could be seen right on the cover. Wintour favored more naturalistic photography of lesser-known models outside, as opposed to the tight headshots the magazine had previously favored. Additionally, Wintour's first Vogue cover was also the first to feature a model wearing jeans, with the added bonus of wearing a bejeweled T-shirt valued at around $10,000. Under Wintour, Vogue has continued to be one of the pillars of fashion journalism.
