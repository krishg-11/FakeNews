Ellen Degeneres $400m divorce leaves Portia de Rossi humiliated

Ellen Degeneres has 'fled' the marital home she shares with Australian starlet Portia de Rossi, setting the sage for a $400m divorce, America's National Enquirer sensationally claims, in a highly controversial report today.

'Multiple sources' have purportedly told the publication the pair got into a fight to end all fights that climaxed with Ellen ripping off her wedding ring and dramatically moving out.

In the bombshell report, the National Enquirer claims Ellen left the couple's LA home and has kept their split hidden from friends.

'It's all very shady and ominous. Ellen went to great lengths to keep the news from their close friends to avoid being asked questions,' an insider sensationally told the publication.

'She and Portia were fighting more and more. Eventually, what normally would have been a routine back-and-forth turned nasty.'
