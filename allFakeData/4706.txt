Halle Berry NOT Pregnant At 50, Despite Reports

Halle Berry is not pregnant at 50, despite a slew of inaccurate reports. Gossip Cop can exclusively correct this fake news. We’re told it’s “simply untrue.”

According to a slew of speculative and incorrect stories, Berry is expecting her third child and debuted a “baby bump” at the 16th Annual Chrysalis Butterfly Ball in Los Angeles. The Mirror, for example, wrote that the actress appeared on the “red carpet proudly cradling a ‘baby bump.'” The British tabloid further claimed Berry “has yet to publicly announce her pregnancy.” “When she stood to the side, the bump was even more apparent, and Halle made no effort to conceal her new curves,” added the misguided newspaper.

Similarly, the fake news manufacturers at HollywoodLife maintained Berry is going to “be a mama for the third time around!” They also cut-and-pasted the phrase that wrongfully alleged the actress was “cradling a baby bump on the carpet.” Since HollywoodLies often speculates rather than actually reports, the repeatedly discredited outlet asserted that that Berry had “quite a glow about her as she rested her hands on the apparent bump with a huge smile on her face.”
