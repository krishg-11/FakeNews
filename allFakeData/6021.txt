Kate Middleton and Prince William May Be Celebrating Prince George’s Birthday on This Caribbean Island

It’s off to paradise for Prince William, Kate Middleton, and their children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis.

Good Morning America reports that the Cambridge family jetted off this week to Mustique, right before their eldest son’s birthday. It’s long been a favorite spot for William and Kate, who have been there a number of times over the years, including for a babymoon when Kate was pregnant with Prince George. It’s said that they were joined on this trip by Kate’s parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, as well as Pippa Middleton and her husband, James Matthews.

They aren’t the first Windsors to set foot on the idyllic Caribbean island—Princess Margaret famously had a house on its sandy shores, where rumor has it she’d throw raucous parties on Macaroni Beach. Her former villa, Les Jolies Eaux, is now available for rent.

If Will and Kate choose to go out and about, they might head to Basil’s Bar. The waterfront hot spot on Britannia Bay is known to be the setting for British blue bloods’ wild nights, and its owner, Basil Charles, was a guest at William and Kate’s 2011 wedding.

But taking it easy is certainly an option. “The beauty of Mustique is that there really isn’t much to do,” Vogue writer Todd Plummer explains in his guide to Mustique. “The staff of your villa can happily arrange some tennis time, maybe a boat excursion or horseback ride, but each villa on the island is such a delight that the best thing to do is ask your chef for a rum punch, lay out on a chaise, and soak up the sun.”
