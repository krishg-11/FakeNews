Rihanna 'feels sexy and more confident with new curves'

Rihanna looked sensational at the Valerian premiere in Paris on Tuesday as she showed off her body in a pink bra with beads and a skirt.

And a source told Hollywood Life on Friday that the 29-year-old Diamonds crooner is fine with her look.

'Rihanna is happy and feels sexy and more confident than ever with her new curves,' said a source.

Rihanna's new shape seems to be attracting plenty of high fashion types.

Hollywood is happy with her too.

Director Luc Besson says getting Rihanna's team on board for her role in the sci-fi epic Valerian And The City Of A Thousand Planets was a little painful at first but worth it in the end.

The pop superstar co-stars in the film as a burlesque dancer named Bubble who performs in a seedy club owned by Ethan Hawke.

Besson says her team was rightfully protective of her at the outset, but that once she was on set, she was focused and generous. Early viewers have hailed Rihanna's small role as a scene-stealer.

The Grammy Award winner had a main role in Battleship and had cameos in the films This Is the End and Annie.

Valerian And the City Of A Thousand Planets hit theaters on July 21.

She can next be seen in Ocean's Eight with Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett.
