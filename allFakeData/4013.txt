Kim Kardashian Rips Kanye West To Step Up His Parenting Game

Kim Rips Bad Dad Kanye: Step Up Your Parenting Game! West has been 'absent' since Kardashian gave birth to baby Chicago.

Krazy Kim Kardashian is ripping into “absent dad” Kanye West, accusing him of not doing nearly enough parentally, a source reveals to RadarOnline.com exclusively!

“Since Chicago came into their lives he’s barely changed a diaper, and it’s Kim who’s up half the night rocking her back to sleep,” snitches a pal.

Yeezy thinks the reality star and hired help can take care of the baby needs. “He just lets her and the nannies get on with it.”

The new set of problems is said to be causing yet another rift in their marriage. “They’ve been in separate beds for weeks now, and he’s detaching himself from Kim again, which is what almost caused their divorce last year.”

As Radar previously reported exclusively, Kimye nearly called it quits after Yeezy’s erratic behavior was destroying their relationship.

“After his breakdown Kanye did everything right, but he’s completely stopped that lately,” the source spilled at the time.

“Kim has told her friends that she doesn’t think he’s taking his meds and he is doing really manic things like staying in the studio all night long. He says he is recording but Kim says he is avoiding her. She has been saying it is time for a divorce.”

The first source told Radar the end was near. “Kim really seems like she’s over the marriage. But she has two kids with another one the way. It’s a tough decision for her.”
