On a night honoring the biggest stars in movies and television, reality stars Kendall and Kylie Jenner were supposedly treated like D-list celebrities.

The Keeping Up With the Kardashians vets, who are usually viewed as royalty everywhere else they go, were reportedly banned from multiple after parties following the 2017 Golden Globes on Sunday, January 8.

Where’s Kim Kardashian when you need her, right?

"They both got rejected from all of the other major after-parties, including Weinstein, HBO, Fox and several others," a source revealed to Radar Online.

Even with a combined 155 million Instagram followers, the Kardashian gals just couldn’t get themselves on any of the other guest lists.

Though the pair did get into the NBC Universal party, sources claim the multiple rejections from other soirees resulted in big time drama between the sisters.

"They were both really upset that the only party they could get into was E!," the source continued.



"Kendall told her friends that if Kylie was not with her, she would have gotten into any of them!"

Yikes — is this the start of some serious sister drama?

Though they may not have had a night full of fun, both ladies looked bangin’ on the red carpet and made sure to show off their flawless couture gowns, even if it was just at one shindig.
