Kelly Ripa Jealous Of Michael Strahanâ€™s Ratings Success On The $100,000 Pyramid Game Show?

Kelly Ripa and Michael Strahan did not end their relationship on positive terms, so itâ€™s not very surprising that Michael Strahanâ€™s ratings success on â€˜The $100,000 Pyramidâ€™ game show reportedly has his former co-host jealous and seething.

After Kellyâ€™s and Michaelâ€™s blowup on â€˜Live With Kellyâ€™, there were plenty of rumors spinning around regarding the future of the show, the future of Kelly Ripaâ€™s career, and the future of Michael Strahanâ€™s career. However, the rumor mill died down a little when Kelly went on to host her show alone, and Michael landed Good Morning America and despite the passive aggressive interviews that Kelly gave since Michaelâ€™s departure (if we can call it that), things between the former co-hosts seemed to have died down a little.

However, Michael Strahanâ€™s new game show â€˜The $100,000 Pyramidâ€™ has been making waves recently, both with ratings and guest stars. ABC has confirmed that stars like Rachael Ray, Tom Bergeron, Aaron Rodgers, and Cam Newton will all be appearing on the second season of â€˜The $100,000 Pyramidâ€™ when it returns in June.

The show has been gaining steam on the game show circuit, and as its been amassing a large fan base and impressive ratings, Kelly Ripa has allegedly felt even more slighted than she did before.

She was reportedly already jealous of the fact that Michaelâ€™s star was rising so quickly, and the fallout from their final days together on the show certainly didnâ€™t help. Plus, the fact that he was immediately inundated with offers from other shows and higher rated shows, at that, reportedly made her seethe more, even though she had to put on a confident facade for the show.

But alas, thereâ€™s only so long that she can keep faking the fact that she doesnâ€™t care about Michaelâ€™s success off the show, especially as she still struggles to find longer term co-hosts whoâ€™ll put up with her alleged attitude problems and diva behavior.

What do you guys think about Kelly Ripaâ€™s jealousy over Michael Strahanâ€™s new career successes? Do you think sheâ€™s still bitter over her former co-starâ€™s ratings bonanza, or has she moved on?
