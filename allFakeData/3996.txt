David Letterman Won’t Give Up His Beard

David Letterman is returning to TV with a new six-episode series on Netflix, but the talk show legend won’t look like his old self!

“Dave is refusing to shave his beard. He has made it clear that if he returns he will do it his way. He will only interview people he wants to talk with, and no one better tell him to shave his beard,” a tattletale whispered to The National ENQUIRER’s own Rob Shuter.
