Kylie Jenner is pregnant with second child, US report

An insider spilled to the US publication, 'She confessed to pals that she was trying for another bay just a couple of months after Stormi was born.'

'Kylie said she'd love for her daughter to have a sibling to play with sooner rather than later,' the source added. 'Now everyone's talking about how she's already showing signs of pregnancy!'

The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star previously revealed that during her first pregnancy, In-N-Out Burger was her weakness.

'It just tastes so good,' she said in an interview.

A friend told Life & Style, 'Kylie has been craving donuts and In-N-Out and she's been super emotional.'

On top of her cravings, the reality star recently confessed she had her lip fillers 'removed', which is advisable during pregnancy.

According to the publication's report, Travis is thrilled with expanding their family.

'Travis is doing backflips,' says the source. 'He can't wait to spread the news.'

Since having Stormi, 'Kylie and Travis are getting along better than ever.'

'And she's convinced that having another baby will bring them even closer together.'

Neither Kylie or Travis have responded to Life & Style's report.
