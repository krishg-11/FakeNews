Selena Gomez Regrets Fighting With Justin Bieber After Cheating Claims Surface

But according to a new message on Snapchat, it seems Gomez regrets fighting with her ex. On Tuesday, the singer wrote, “What I said was selfish and pointless,” set against a dark background.

The incident started when Bieber asked his fans to be nice to his new love interest, 17-year-old Sofia Richie. Gomez decided to stir up drama by telling her ex in a comment on Instagram that he should respect his fans.

Things got even messier when she accused Bieber of cheating on her. He responded by saying that she stepped out on him with singer Zayn Malik. Drama, drama, drama!

After the back-and-forth with Selena, Bieber simply deleted his Instagram account, erasing any evidence of the former couple’s feud with it.

We’re just happy this fight is over and we can go back to living our lives in peace.
