Paulina Rubio is Collaborating With Selena Gomez & DJ Snake on Forthcoming Album

During an interview withVanidades, Latin superstar Paulina Rubio said she is collaborating with Selena Gomez and DJ Snake on her forthcoming album.

"My new album is like another member of the team, or the family. It will be a true warrior, has something from all genres, from banda to pop, collaborations with DJ Snake and Selena Gomez. I tried to keep a key element: that the music is danceable," the Mexican singer shared with the magazine.

Earlier this year, Rubio released three new singles, "Si te vas," "Mi nuevo vicio" and "Me quemas," ahead of her LP slated to drop in 2017.

The news of their unexpected collab comes just months after Gomez returned to the spotlight following her musical hiatus at the 2016 American Music Awards, where she gave a heartfelt and inspirational speech.

This will be the first time Gomez and the former X-Factor judge, who recently performed with Demi Lovato during a concert in Mexico City, have teamed up for a single.
