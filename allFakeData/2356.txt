Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban Went to Retreat to Save Marriage

In Touch has learned that Nicole Kidman and husband of nearly 12 years Keith Urban, had a five-day visit to Marriage Quest, a private counseling retreat located in Cabot, Vt. “Nicole and Keith went for an emergency stay,” an insider tells In Touch exclusively of the pair. “It was an extremely emotional and testing few days.”

The couple, who share daughters Sunday, 9, and Faith, 7, “have been fighting constantly over Nicole’s incessant jealousy and need to control Keith on every level,” adds the insider. The trip to Vermont marked their final attempt to patch things up. “It was Keith’s idea to visit the boot camp,” says the insider. The Lion actress resisted and only relented when Keith threatened to leave for good. “He gave her an ultimatum.”

But in Vermont, the pair were side by side as they hashed out their problems. “They addressed a range of issues, including emotional intimacy, and focused on the root of their problems as they learned to break down walls and start working on their issues rather than plastering over the cracks,” the insider explains.
