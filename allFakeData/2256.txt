Why Princess Charlotte Never Wears Pants

While Prince George is barely ever seen out of his little blue shorts, three-year-old Charlotte is always sporting a feminine dress.

Though Meghan Markle has been told not to wear a tuxedo because the Queen prefers women in skirts and dresses, the reason Princess Charlotte is always in a frock is less extreme: Kate Middleton wants to keep her daughter in classic looks so the photos don't date.

“If they wear very simple things… it’s timeless in that you can’t really date a specific photo or put them in something that seems out of date,” designer Rachel Riley, who has dressed Prince George before, told The Telegraph.

Woman and Home also notes that Kate puts Charlotte in traditional 'old-fashioned' outfits for official royal occasions because it marks the formality of the event.

While the above makes sense, we'd be lying if we said we weren't now praying for Charlotte to step out in an adorable mini pantsuit, like her new aunt Meghan Markle.
