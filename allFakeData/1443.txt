BREAKING: Santa Fe Killer Confesses His Love For Obama

The 17-year-old murderer who gunned down 10 people in cold blood was originally reported to be a Muslim, then a member of MS-13. In the very least we thought his ethnic name meant there would be some reason to be able to tie him to something other than right-wing terrorism. Now we have that reason.

Dimitrius Pagopogouritz is a liberal whose immigrant parents raised him on welfare in the projects of San Dimas. In a leaked interview with police after the shooting, he admitted he was an Obama-loving moonbat who was looking to “end gun violence” by adding another shooting:

“I just figured if I caused enough damage maybe my school could be the next Parkland.”

But that’s how liberals think, isn’t it? The leak came from a source who is well-known inside the Texas Rangers Inner-City Cooperative that pairs wealthy white folks with impoverished black and Latino kids to make them some extra money mowing lawns and doing some gardening. According to celebrity spokesman Chuck Norris:

“I ended up firing my gardener and his crew of illegals and now I get my get the same quality work for a fraction of the price. These kids aren’t bound by minimum wages or workman’s comp restrictions. They’d be crippled. They do us a favor and we tip them 10 or 20 bucks. For a Saturday of gaining valuable human capital and the reference of a film and TV star? That’s well worth it.”

Donatelliarius Souflakitariopolous, the killer’s grandfather, is currently serving a life sentence for murder and grand theft of more than 6000 pounds of tainted turkey bacon. The two cases aren’t related.
