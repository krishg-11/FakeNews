Dates are always sweeter when there’s candy involved.

Page Six has learned that Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez took a trip to Seattle and stopped by Sugar Factory, Bellevue, this weekend with two friends. The on-again couple were spotted holding hands while hanging out with some pals.

“They seemed to have a great time,” a source told Page Six on Monday.

Despite both being able to legally consume alcohol, The Biebs, 23, and Gomez, 25, shared a virgin version of the Ocean Blue Goblet.

There’s no saying if the “Sorry” crooner and Gomez left with a sugar high.
