Lionel Richie tracks Sofia Richie's phone

Its built into iPhones. One does not even need an extra app. I sometimes use it so my mom / friends know how close i am to the meeting point Reply

I have an app for that and it's extremely handy. I also check how far they're away or where I have to meet them. Reply

This reminds me the time some students and their parents were sitting in on a class I was teaching one time and after one of the mothers asked me afterwards about how safe the campus is and stuff (completely understandable). Then was talking about how after her daughter graduates high school and goes to college she still wants to track her phone. Her daughter was standing there so awkwardly. Reply

sadly we live in scary times and I could very much see why a parent would worry and want to know where their kids are, especially when and if they don't answer when they call/reply to texts, etc.

Before smartphones I knew this girl in high school who lived with her grandparents and they made her call them when she got to school, between every class and as she was leaving to go home. They would check her odometer every day to make sure she only went to and from school and she'd be questioned if the miles didn't match up.



Once she was late getting home by like 15 minutes because she offered to drive a classmate home who missed the bus, and she said her grandparents took her tv and computer away from her for two weeks for that.



Once she got to college she basically immediately realized how fucked up everything was and cut them out of her life. Reply

My fam had that, too, and my sister was ALWAYS tracking our dad but he never tracked her back. That cracked my ass up. Reply

I don't plan on having kids because the world is so unbelievably fucked up but if I do I've decided that I'll put several GPSs on their things and one on their person maybe behind an ear or back of a knee. Like legit not joking, I'd get something like the pet tracker thing and I'd never tell anyone not even my partner if I have one (This thinking is really fucked up I know so maybe it's a good thing that I don't plan on having any kids). But to me it's not about not trusting the kid(s) it's about not trusting the world. My kid(s) would be black immigrants and most likely Muslim so with all that I'd like to know where they are/were last if something happened to them. I'd only check it if I couldn't get a hold of them for a few hours but other than that never. I'm generally a paranoid person so I know I'd be even more so as a parent. Reply

It seems practical, as long as respectful boundaries are in place. It would have less to do with trust, and more about the way women seem to be seen as targets. It's really strange to me that people react differently when I'm walking by myself vs. when I'm walking with my 6'3" husband, for example. When it's just me, it looks like certain people are sizing me up. If he's with me, people actively avoid looking at us. Reply

Late af but my mum is a really anxious person and I kind of wish this had been a thing when I was a teenager just for her peace of mind. She trusted me 100% but she had this awful fear that something bad would happen to me - like I'd be snatched or involved in a road accident. The difference I suppose is that she would be tracking me with my consent. Reply

When she's partying with dads/grown ass men and women as a teen I guess I understand why he'd do it. Reply

I think it should be the opposite. Let her go where she wants, but don't foot the bill for her lifestyle of boozing and hanging out with creepy older guys. Reply

Oh please. Just because 18/19 year olds are legally adults doesn't mean they're not still dumb as fuck and emotionally and physically immature. They're still adolescents. Reply

It's legally an adult but they're still mentally a child and need guidance in life. No 18\19 year old should be hanging out with a mid 30 year old man Reply

I don't think it's creepy; she is somewhat famous/high profile and we live in scary times PLUS nicole was a wild child so he's probably trying to keep his eye on her in an effort to keep her safe/help her make good choices. Reply

I don't know if it's invasion of privacy or not because it all depends on their relationship. I grew up with parents who had a firm "If you live in my house, I'm gonna be checking your room" policy then when I was an adult they told me they trusted me enough to make my own decisions. This girl seems to make really shitty decisions so.



Then again, I'm married, in my 30s and live in my own place yet I STILL call my parents and tell them where I am obsessively. I have some trauma-based anxiety about it. I'd probs let my parents track my phone if they had any knowledge of how to use apps.

I'm in my 30s and my mom has a phone tracker for me, but it's for her peace of mind. We have more of a best friend relationship anyway so I don't care if it makes her feel better. I'm only ever at home or at work anyway lol.



That said, I wouldn't track anyone, but I don't have that kinda relationship with anyone anyway. I do care about my privacy so I'd be pissed if anyone but my mom did that. Reply

I have this relationship with my mum too. She's like obsessively worried about my safety and tbh I wish she was phone savvy enough to do this because it would make her much more calm and I have nothing that I hide from her anyway. We're basically bffs and even though I'm an adult and don't live with her I don't like to think of her worrying about me. Then again, like you said, it's 100% down to the parent child relationship when it comes to whether or not tracking is okay. Reply

I think it'd be healthier to, y'know, talk to her about where she's going and what her plans are, but failing that, I guessâ€¦



My parents trusted me as a teen (I was a lame overachiever lol) and don't particularly care what I do now that I'm an adult but ngl I will text my mom the ETA every time I take an Uber alone 'cause I want someone to know if I get kidnapped/murdered :P

All depends on the relationship that he has with his kid and his general disposition. If he was tracking her more frequently I would be worried. He probably thinks tracking her once a day to make sure she's okay is better than nagging her about her whereabouts, but you know. Reply
