‘Grow The F**k Up!’ Sofia Slams Kourtney's 'Crap' Over Spending Time With Her Kids

‘Grow The F**k Up!’ Sofia Slams Kourtney's 'Crap' Over Spending Time With Her Kids

‘Grow The F**k Up!’ Sofia Slams Kourtney's 'Crap' Over Spending Time With Her Kids Richie wants Kourt to ‘stop inserting herself into her & Scott's life,’ says source.

Sofia Richie isn’t stepping down to boyfriend Scott Disick’s baby mama Kourtney Kardashian any longer!

“Sofia is so tired of hearing Kourtney’s crap about how she wants her to stay away from her and Scott’s kids,” a source close to the 19-year-old told RadarOnline.com exclusively.

“She really just wants Kourtney to stop inserting herself into her and Scott’s life and she wants to be left alone.”

As fans know, Kardashian, 39, has been co-parenting her three children with baby daddy Disick, 34, since the pair split over two years ago.

Since then, Richie — who just inked a massive contract to star on the upcoming season of Keeping up with the Kardashians — has been spotted on numerous occasions with Disick’s kids — much to Kardashian’s dismay.

“Sofia has every right to get as close to Scott and his kids as she wants and she thinks that Kourtney just needs to grow the f**k up,” the source told Radar.

“Scott is her man. If Kourtney really wanted to work things out with Scott she could have. But it’s her loss.”
