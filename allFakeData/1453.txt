MITT ROMNEY: ‘TRUMP HAS SOME VERY SERIOUS EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS, HE MUST RESIGN BEFORE WE…’

AMID AN INTERVIEW ON CNN’S “AC360,” FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MITT ROMNEY URGED PRESIDENT TRUMP TO LEAVE OFFICE OVER THE SEXUAL MISCONDUCT CLAIMS AGAINST HIM AND COMMENTED THAT THE PRESIDENT “HAS SOME VERY SERIOUS EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS.”

Romney shared his opinion on Trump’s controversial tweets by sayin:

“I think you’ve got a president who has some very serious emotional problems.”

“I’m especially concerned about his constant tweets about North Korea. It’s already bad and he is adding fuel to the fire.”

Romney added, “You’ve got a president who has been accused, by many, many women of harassment, to say the least. This is a guy who was on a tape seen by everybody in America essentially bragging about his sexual assault of women.”

“Do I think under those considerations of Al Franken resigned, do I think the president should resign? I do. Do I think he will? I don’t. But, yes, I do think he should resign.”

Romney continued, “Let me take it a little step further. We have a president of the United States who acknowledged on a tape widely seen all over the country that he’s assaulted women, so I would hope maybe the president of the United States might pay attention of what’s going on and also think about resigning. But if your point is it is not just Al Franken you are absolutely right.”

Not long ago Mitt Romney also stated that President Trump is “trying to divide us up by the color of our skin.”
