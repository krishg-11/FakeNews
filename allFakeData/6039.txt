Amber Rose Shuts Down French Montana Dating Rumors, Calls Rapper Her 'Bruvaaa'

Amber Rose is reminding her Rosebuds that she's still single!

Since splitting with Val Chmerkovskiy in February, rumors have been swirling that the model has sparked up a romantic relationship with rapper French Montana. Although the two were all smiles in the pics and videos posted from a birthday they attended, their captions seemed to say it all -- they're more like family.

On Saturday, Rose and French both took to Instagram to share highlights from hip-hop artist Belly's birthday bash. In one of the videos, the former Dancing With the Stars contestant lays her head on French's chest, flirting with the camera.

"My bruvaaa @frenchmontana," she captioned it. "??? straight ???#UNFORGETTABLE."

"Happy Birthday @belly," another post read, which featured MUVA rocking a bright orange dress as she posed with the birthday boy and Basketball Wives star Duffey.

And according to a snap posted by French, Drake later joined in on the party, too!

Earlier this month, Rose and French initiated renewed romance rumors when the two both posted the same sexy pic to Instagram. Rose's post remains on her page with the caption "my muf**kin Bruva," while the rapper has since deleted his (though, to be fair, he did undergo a major social media clean-up in order to put full focus on his new single, "Unforgettable").
