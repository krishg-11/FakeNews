Sandra Bullock Reveals Current Views on Marriage After Adopting Second Child

Sandra Bullock is opening up about her current views on marriage after adopting her second child (a little girl named Laila!)

When asked if she could see herself getting married again, the 51-year-old Oscar winner responded, “I don’t think so, but I can see myself in a committed, safe relationship where there is lots of love and laughter, and ‘making memories’ is No. 1 on the to-do list.”

Sandra is reportedly currently dating photographer Bryan Randall (who actually photographed the cover story spread for People mag’s reveal).

Sandra also was asked if her family, including son Louis, 5, was traditional.

“If a traditional home is one that is filled with lots of love and poop jokes, no sleep, schedule books filled with more kids’ social events than adults’ and lots of yelling over who touched who first … then I have a very traditional family,” Sandra added.
