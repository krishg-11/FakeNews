Carrie Underwood Forced Mike Fisher To Retire For Second Baby?

Did Carrie Underwood force Mike Fisher to retire so they can have a second baby? That’s the claim in this week’s tabloids. Gossip Cop, however, can reveal what’s really going on.

“Carrie Underwood: Baby #2 To Save Marriage,” reads a headline in the new issue of Star, which contends, “The country superstar pushed hubby Mike Fisher to quit pro hockey so they could work on their troubled relationship and having another child together.” After Fisher announced his retirement earlier this month, the tabloid is now claiming Underwood “made sure Mike understood it was the right time” to call it quits on his playing days.

A so-called “source” is quoted as saying, “Carrie told Mike in no uncertain terms to hang up his skates, in a dramatic attempt to get more together time to mend their troubled relationship.” But the gossip magazine’s supposed snitch doesn’t seem to have first-hand knowledge to back that assertion up. “I heard that she had become really unhappy with the situation. Having Mike home will be one solution, and I believe she hopes that having another baby together will bring them even closer than when they first fell in love,” the purported tipster is quoted as saying.
