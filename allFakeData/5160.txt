Sugar mama splurges!

RadarOnline.com has learned exclusively lonely Caitlyn Jenner is dropping $50,000 a week on her girlfriend Sophia Hutchins!

The two haven’t even been dating a year but the transgender star is already spending the big bucks to keep her gal pal sweet. “Caitlyn is spending an absolute fortune on Sophia,” dished a source. “She’s constantly treating her to drinks and dinners at the nicest restaurants in town and buys her jewelry and handbags all the time!”

But it’s not just that she’s showering her with gifts – she’s also given Hutchins her own credit card and a weekly allowance.

“Sophia is using Caitlyn’s cash to deck out her wardrobe with designer clothes and get her hair and nails done every week.”

She’s also spending thousands on facials and massages! “This is costing Caitlyn at least $50,000 each week but she thinks nothing of this weird arrangement.”

“She’s desperate for Sophia to stick around and this is her way of sealing the deal.”

Radar has followed Jenner’s increasingly close relationship with young blonde Hutchins for months.

Jenner and Hutchins were first seen together when they vacationed in Cabo, Mexico.

Jenner is constantly hanging out with beautiful Hutchins, who, as Radar reported, was born a man but later transitioned to female.
