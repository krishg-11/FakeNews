Mike Tyson Offered SERIOUS Ca$h To Fight Russian Dictator Vladimir Putin Will the former pro-boxer punch the president’s lights out for money?

In the fight of the century, former pro-boxer Mike Tyson may be getting into the rink with Russian President Vladimir Putin, RadarOnline.com has learned.

Sources have confessed to Straight Shuter that very wealthy businessmen have offered the 51-year-old pro boxer over $500K to travel to Russia and have a boxing match with the 64-year-old President.

He has also been offered a small fortune to do a convention in New York City, backed of course, by the Russians.

Investors have even offered to fly him to the powerful country and translate his book into Russian if he accepts to participate in the fight.

As Radar readers know, Putin has recently been busted for having a bizarre Hollywood the list filled with dirty secretes on Tinseltown’s biggest stars – all of which he is reportedly prepared to expose if they crusade against Russian outrages.

The award-winning boxer has yet to comment on the matter of the fight.
