Keith Urban & Sophie Monk: Why Nicole is furious

Sources tell New Idea that the 38-year-old blonde has decided to put her search for Mr Right on hold after her failed romance with Stu, and is now focusing on reviving her music career in 2018. And it seems she’s turned to four-time Grammy winner Keith to help make her singing dreams come true.

‘They met in Los Angeles when Sophie was trying to forge a career in Hollywood, and they have stayed friendly over the years,’ says an insider. ‘With all the commotion caused by her appearance on The Bachelorette, Sophie has been thinking about getting out of Australia for a while. She has been doing a lot of crying on Keith’s shoulder.’
