Scott Disick‘s girlfriend Sofia Richie celebrated her 20th birthday in a bikini — and his ex Kourtney Kardashian apparently refused to be outdone, following up with a topless shot.

“I’m like goddamn bitch, I am not a teen choice #20,” Richie captioned her sultry snap.

Hours later on Friday, Kardashian, 39, took to her Instagram story from a swanky walk-in closet wearing jeans, heels and nothing on top but a necklace — plus her arm and a text bar reading “proud wife” obscuring her nipples. She captioned the image, “I swear this is about [pal] Steph [Shepherd’s] jeans.”

Richie has been dating Disick, 35, for about a year.

Kardashian, who shares sons Mason and Reign and daughter Penelope with Disick, split from a much younger lover of her own, 25-year-old model Younes Bendjima, earlier this month.

Disick and Kardashian discussed their rocky on-again-off-again romance on the 10-year-anniversary special of “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” in September 2017.

“The debauchery that’s gone on has definitely closed the door several billion times [on a reconciliation], but it’s been back open,” Kardashian said at the time.

Disick quipped, “Here’s the thing, every time I become too good of a person, she stops loving me because she fell in love with a guy who was a little bit f–ked up … I treat you like royalty, you don’t say hello to me. I spit in your face, you’re like, ‘Hey babe.’ ”

Kardashian and Disick split, seemingly for good, in July 2015.
