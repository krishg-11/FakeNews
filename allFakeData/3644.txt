Meghan Markle Dumps American Friends After Marrying Prince Harry

Meghan Dumps American Friends & Family After Royal Wedding Markle hasn’t even spoken to her dad since marrying Prince Harry.



Meghan Markle has moved on after her glamorous wedding to Prince Harry, RadarOnline.com has learned exclusively, leaving her American friends and family in her glittering dust.

On the latest episode of the popular podcast Straight Shuter!, host Rob Shuter reveals the newest member of the Harry’s royal family is putting her past behind her.

“Her old friends feel a little bit dumped,” a source told Shuter. “First, they attended her wedding at their own expense, and now Meghan is a little too busy for all of them.”

Shuter’s sources say the new Duchess of Sussex has completely adapted to her new lifestyle, complete with new email address and specialized British phone number.

“A lot of her old friends can’t even reach her anymore,” the source added. “They don’t know how to get in touch with Meghan and she’s not getting in touch with them.”

In fact, as she continues to adapt and adjust to her new royal lifestyle, Markle even seems to have cut ties to her troubled father, Thomas.

“Her dad says he has not spoken to Meghan since just after the wedding,” Shuter reveals. “He tried to call her and the number that he has for her no longer works, or nobody is answering it.”

But don’t think Meghan is lonely in her castle. Shuter says she’s replaced her old group of friends with a new, more regal group, including new besties Amal Clooney and Victoria Beckham.
