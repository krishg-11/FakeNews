Caitlyn Jenner Finally Ends Her Silence About Sophia Hutchins, But Is This a Relationship Confirmation?

The transgender athlete and the director of the Caitlyn Jenner Foundation are inseparable.

Caitlyn Jenner, 68, is nearly inseparable with Sophia Hutchins, a 22-year-old transgender woman who is the executive director of the Caitlyn Jenner Foundation, a transgender rights organization created in 2017. Caitlyn and Sophia frequently appear in each other's social media feeds, and Sophia accompanied Caitlyn to the ESPY Awards in July, though they weren't red carpet official.

Naturally, people have been assuming that they are a couple, but Caitlyn and Sophia both denied that they're in a relationship when asked by Variety, which concluded they "sound like a couple."



“We are not going to get into that,” Caitlyn told the publication. “But we are very close. We do a lot of things together. We’re kind of inseparable. We’re the best of friends.”

Caitlyn has been open about being isolated from her children — one of whom, Kendall Jenner, is the same age as Sophia.

"I spend a lot of time by myself here in the house," she revealed to Broadly. "I have a lot of children, but sometimes just because of circumstances, maintaining a close relationship with your kids is very tough. They all have lives. They've all moved on."
