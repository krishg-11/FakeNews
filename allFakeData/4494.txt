Strange things about Reese Witherspoon and Jim Toth's marriage

In 2013, fans of the Wild actress were shocked to learn that America's sweetheart was arrested in Atlanta, Georgia. Witherspoon, who became irate after her husband was pulled over for driving in the wrong lane, (via Variety) was booked for disorderly conduct. Variety said she screamed at an Atlanta police officer, "Do you know my nameâ€¦you're about to find out who I am!" and refused to stay in her car.



Toth, who was also arrested on a suspected DUI charge, blew a .139 on a breathalyzer test (the legal limit is Georgia is .08), according to the publication. She later apologized for her behavior via her publicist. "Out of respect for the ongoing legal situation, I cannot comment on everything that is being reported right now. But I do want to say, I clearly had one drink too many and I am deeply embarrassed about the things I said," she told Us Weekly.
