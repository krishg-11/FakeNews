Exclusive: Why Sandra Bullock & Bryan Randall Aren't Getting Engaged

Sandra Bullock and Bryan Randall are in a great place.

The couple, who have been dating for about a year and a half, are "doing perfectly," a source tells E! News exclusively. Even though Bullock is busy filming Ocean's Eight, she and Randall have made their relationship a priority. "They have been really busy but always make time to see each other," the insider adds. "They are very content with how things are going in their relationship."

Although she's an A-list star, Bullock prefers her relationship remain private, which is exactly her beau's style. "They enjoy the simple and quiet times together," the source adds, noting that they've taken a big step in their relationship. "Bryan and Sandra live together, and he helps with Sandra's kids like they are his own."
