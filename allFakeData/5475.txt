Meghan Markle to be hit with EXPLOSIVE revelations as sister Samantha ready to TELL ALL

Samantha, 53, is intent on telling all, including dirt about the Markle family. She revealed: “Everyone will just have to read it to see what really goes on in the shadows. “My book is much more comprehensive as it definitely takes an in-depth look. (It is an) in-depth look at the unspoken dynamics through and beyond the wedding.” She then promised readers that “opening the book and reading it puts a spotlight on the shadows.”

She has changed the title of her book, which was once called ‘The Diary of Princess Pushy’s Sister’, to ‘In The Shadows of The Duchess’. Samantha lives in Florida and has not seen Meghan in over a decade, but is nevertheless quick to criticise the Duchess. Samantha’s latest reveal comes after she dubbed the Duchess of Sussex - who married Prince Harry in Windsor on May 19 – the “Duchess of Nonsense” earlier this month. Ms Markle claimed Prince Harry should have married his ex-girlfriend, Cressida Bonas – and claimed that his mother, the late Princess of Wales, would be “ashamed”.

Meghan and Samantha’s father Thomas Markle, a retired lighting director who lives in Mexico, did not attend the royal wedding ay Windsor Castle, reportedly after a heart attack just days before the event.
