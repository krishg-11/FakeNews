Kathy Griffin claims neighbor called her ‘stupid b-tch’ as legal battle escalates

A damning video emerged as Kathy Griffin continues her legal battle for a restraining order against her neighbor, the CEO of KB Homes, according to reports.

The comedian will return to court Tuesday with what she claims is evidence that neighbor Jeffrey Mezger’s profanity-laced rant against her in September wasn’t an isolated incident.

Griffin and her legal team plan to introduce a new video and two audio clips in which Mezger and his wife, Sandra, allegedly can be heard ranting about Griffin.

In a May 26 video obtained by The Blast, the CEO was shown shouting at Griffin about closing her door while standing at the fence between their yards.

“Stupid b-tch,” he was recorded saying.

In another audio clip, Mezger’s wife was reportedly heard discussing how the comedian and her boyfriend called in a noise complaint about them.

“It’s f–king crap,” she reportedly said. “F–king crap. F–king, f–king crap!”

Mezger’s attorney, Pete Slevin, denied that it was his client heard in the recording.

“Moreover, the recording was apparently dated May 26, 2017, and hence does not reflect any statement ‘amid’ the so-called legal battle,” Slevin said in a statement. “We look forward to putting on sworn testimony tomorrow that completely contradicts the assertions.”

The neighbors’ feud hasn’t simmered down since he was recorded hurling homophobic and sexist slurs at the comedian in September.

In October, Mezger filed for his own restraining order against Griffin — two weeks after she filed one against him.

Following the initial tirade, KB Homes’ board threatened to fire Mezger “if in the future there is any similar incident.”
