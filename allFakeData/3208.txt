Britney Spears and Her BF Do the Craziest Couples Workout You’ve Ever Seen

We thought J-Lo and A-Rod were fitness couple goals ... until we saw this incredible video that Britney Spears just posted on Instagram. The pop singer and her boyfriend Sam Asghari take hitting the gym together to a whole new level, and prove just how in shape they really are.

Let's just say that if you attempted this in the gym with your partner, it probably wouldn't go this smoothly. Asghari actually bench presses Spears, and in another crazy move, she does a plank while perched on his back as he's doing pushups. Whoa! "Stronger together," Spears wrote in the caption. You just have to watch it to believe it (also their situp kisses are too cute).
