She made a royal killing.

A British woman named Claire Oliver hawked her free royal wedding gift bag on eBay — for close to $30,000.

The 31-year-old human resources manager was one of the 1,200 people invited to spend Saturday outside St George’s Chapel to get a peek at the royal couple on their big day, for demonstrating “strong leadership in their communities.”

“I get to watch the royal wedding right outside Windsor Castle in this amazing setting. Such an amazing day #Goldenticket #RoyalConnections,” she posted on Twitter the day of the wedding, according to the Daily Mail.

She scored the coveted invite because she works for Troup Bywaters — an engineering firm whose work offering young people apprenticeships is a cause close to Prince Harry’s heart.

Hours after Harry, 33, and Meghan Markle, 36, exchanged “I wills,” Oliver posted her free goody bag on the online auction site — and sold it for $28,557, after 83 people bid on it.

The canvas bag, embroidered with the couple’s initials, contains a welcome letter from the couple, a bottle of Windsor Castle water, a giant chocolate coin, a fridge magnet, a tin of shortbread and a 20 percent off coupon at the castle gift shop.

While the cash Oliver made from the free goodies is quite a haul, other gift bag auctions had reached close to $70,000 on Wednesday.

If that’s out of your budget for royal swag, some gift bags put up on eBay more recently are still going for as low as $260.

eBay did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
