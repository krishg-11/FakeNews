Jennifer Aniston Cuts Ties With Anyone Loyal To Ex Justin Theroux

Forgotten ‘Friends!’ Jennifer Bans Ex Justin From Her Social Circle Aniston is cutting ties with anyone loyal to Theroux.

Jennifer Aniston is hiring a whole new set of hairdressers, colorists and fashion stylists – because RadarOnline.com has learned exclusively she doesn’t want to be handled by anyone who works with Justin Theroux.

“It’s annoying that pretty much everyone she used before is now taking appointments with Justin,” an insider claimed to Radar. “She was friends with a lot of them, but she’s had to let these people go if they’re not loyal.”

Case in point, Aniston, 49, has already dumped her hairstylist and close friend Chris McMillan, who created the famous “Rachel” hairstyle for the Friends star, after he continued to service and style Theroux.

As far as Jen’s concerned it’s her or Justin and she doesn’t want to be a part of Justin’s social chain,” the source claimed.

As Radar readers know, Aniston, and Theroux, 46, called it quits this February 15, 2018, after just two years of marriage. According to various sources, the two had been leading separate lives for months, and often disagreed on basic things such as where to live and whether or not to start a family.

After the messy divorce, the two couldn’t find common ground among their shared friends, especially those Theroux may be interested in having more than a friendship with.

“Jen was angry enough to see him at dinner with Emma Stone, whom she considers a friend. But then she has to contend with new photos of him schmoozing all over Selena Gomez and it’s really tipped her over the edge,” spilled an informant.
