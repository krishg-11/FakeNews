Hugh Jackman Plans To Get Fat Now That He’s Done Playing Wolverine

Hugh Jackman was a guest on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert tonight, and Colbert had an important question for the Logan actor: now that he’s done playing Wolverine, will we finally get to see “fat Jackman?”

Jackman has been playing Wolverine since 1999, and it’s been seventeen years that he’s had to stay in peak physical condition so that he could perform shirtless scenes for the movies. Jackman even described the process that goes into the filming of shirtless scenes, which he said involves drinking ten liters of water a day in the months leading up to the scenes, which he said are accomplished through dehydration.

“It’s sort of unbelievable to me, what I did for seventeen years,” Jackman revealed. “The first one, I thought you could get into shape in three weeks. The director pushed all the ‘shirt off’ scenes to the very end.”

“You stop drinking water about 30 hours before you shoot,” Jackman said, explaining the process. “You lose ten pounds of water weight.”

But now that that’s over, Jackman is already enjoying himself.

“Now I’m eating and loving it,” Jackman told Colbert. “Sometimes waking up at two in the morning just to have breakfast cereal, and then go back to bed.”

“With it still in my lap,” he added.

One of us! One of us! One of us!

Logan is in theaters now.
