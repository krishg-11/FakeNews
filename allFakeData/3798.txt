Kim Kardashian Replaces Kris Jenner as Manager on 'KUWTK'





Goodbye, momager — and hello, Kim-ager. When Kris Jenner is exhausted in bed with too much on her plate, Kim Kardashian proves that she can take over her mom’s job in a pinch, as seen in a preview for Keeping Up With the Kardashians‘ season 12 finale on Sunday, November 20.

“I’ve joked a lot that I could be my sisters’ manager better than my mom could be,” Kardashian reveals. “I think I do give a lot of good creative input, and I know they, like, listen.”

Her big talk is put to the test when she volunteers to help out her mom with scheduling an Australia event for Kylie Jenner. However, Kris isn’t so sure Kardashian can handle the workload. “It’s a lot of details,” Kris warns her daughter. “You’d probably lose focus in five minutes.”

Still, Kardashian is unfazed by Kris’ doubts. “Why don’t you just chill? I’ll help you,” she tells her mom, adding that Kylie will need security and one person to do hair and makeup. “Have them pay for hotel, flights and a fee,” she instructs, showing off her knowledge of management.

Kris, 61, assures the Selfish author, 36, that the job isn’t as easy as it seems: “It’s ‘take care of your own travel,’ so I would need you to get on the phone with a travel agent,” she explains.

Does this scare Kardashian? Absolutely not, as she fires back without hesitation, “Let me get her on the phone,” already dialing the number for the travel agent.

“I feel like I could totally handle this,” Kardashian quips about Kris’ position as momager. Clearly she knows what she’s talking about.
