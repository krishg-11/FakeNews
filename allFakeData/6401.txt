Irina Shayk Pregnant Bradley Cooper Miserable Fight -- Couple May Breakup Engaged

Pregnant & Alone? Bradley Cooper & Fianceé Irina Shayk's 'Relationship On The Rocks' Actor 'has never looked so miserable,' an insider claims.

Misery before baby? Bradley Cooper‘s recent malaise about his pregnant baby mama and wife-to-be Irina Shayk have sparked worries that their engagement could be on the rocks.

As the stunning model, 31, and her actor fiancé, 42, prepare to welcome their first child, a source close to the couple told RadarOnline.com exclusively that the couple’s relationship has hit a low point.

“Bradley has never looked so miserable,” a source told Radar about witnessing the way the Silver Linings Playbook star acts around his model fiancée.

The hot pair, who once weren’t able to hide their attraction to each other during steamy PDA make out sessions all over the world, have been keeping a very low profile as they get ready to become parents.

As Radar exclusively reported, Cooper proposed to Shayk with an emerald and diamond engagement ring, but those close to the couple observed his changed demeanor in the last few weeks.

Do you think Bradley and his pregnant fiancée’s relationship will last? Sound off in the comments below.
