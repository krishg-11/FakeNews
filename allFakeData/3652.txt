Lindsay Lohan went full-on Mischa Barton with tribute to terrorism victims

Those who fail to learn from the history of Mischa Barton are doomed to repeat it.

Lindsay Lohan made the confounding decision to accompany a sultry Instagram with a caption expressing sympathy for victims of terrorist attacks in Nice and Turkey. She calls on her fans, who deserve so much more to show for their years of loyalty, to "#turnup and do something (goodnight and sleep with an idea for the future)."

If history were to be folded ... Where would we put the crease? Pray for the ones we lose everyday and appreciate every breathe you 🙏🏻 we🙏🏻 all 🙏🏻 take #nice #turkey #turnup and do something (goodnight and sleep with an idea for the future) A photo posted by Lindsay Lohan (@lindsaylohan) on Jul 18, 2016 at 4:23pm PDT

Her heart could have been in the right place, even if her head certainly was not. Maybe she genuinely thought a cute selfie would help usher in an era of peace and goodwill amongst men.

Of course, we're just assuming this is Lindsay. Maybe she swapped places with her long-lost twin sister. Or she could have swapped bodies with Dina Lohan! Or maybe she's just pretending to infiltrate the world of clueless celebrities so she can take them down one by one, but she totally plans to go back to hanging out with Janis and Damian when it's all over! Can we blame Herbie for this mess? Certainly!

If Lindsay Lohan's career were to be folded ... where would we put the crease?
