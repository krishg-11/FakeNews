Brad Pitt did NOT skip the 2017 Oscars because he wanted to avoid seeing Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux, despite a bogus webloid report. Gossip Cop can exclusively debunk this claim. We’re told it’s “totally false.”“Brad Pitt Skips 2017 Oscars After Angelina Jolie Divorce: Couldn’t Bear To See Ex Jennifer Aniston Happy With Justin Theroux?” blares a new Celeb Dirty Laundry headline. Pitt produced Best Picture winner Moonlight, but the site purports that he didn’t attend the awards show because he “couldn’t bear the spotlight,” so he stayed home “skulking.”Without a single source to back up its claim, the repeatedly discredited website adds, “There’s also a high chance that he just wanted to avoid seeing Jennifer Aniston with her husband, Justin Theroux.” The unreliable webloid further claims, “Obviously, had Brad gone to the Oscars, he would have felt some regret when he saw his ex-wife happily married to another man when he was single and depressed.”Despite the outlet’s report being entirely baseless, Gossip Cop still checked in with a rep for Pitt, who exclusively assures us the story is “totally false.” The actor’s reason for not attending the Academy Awards had absolutely nothing to do with Aniston or Theroux, and the claim otherwise is ridiculous.Of course, this isn’t the first time Gossip Cop has had to call out CDL for concocting a nonexistent love triangle between the stars. We previously busted the webloid for falsely claiming Theroux warned Pitt to stay away from Aniston. Gossip Cop also debunked the site’s tall tale about Aniston trying to make Theroux look like Pitt. This latest story is similarly bogus.
