Royal wedding: Does Kate Middleton plan to upstage Meghan Markle with a tiara?

Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton, 36, appear to have struck up a friendship since they met.

However, now an expert has predicted that the Duchess of Cambridge may make a jewellery choice that might ruffle some bridesâ€™ feathers.

For most the onus on a wedding day is to not upstage the bride.

This may especially be a concern for beautiful mother-of-three Kate, who the photographers will be keen to snap on the day.

The Duchess, who married Prince William in April 2011, has a large wardrobe of gems and lavish gowns to choose from.
