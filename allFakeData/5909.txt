Shotgun Wedding? Ben Affleck & Lindsay To Elope In Hawaii Amid Pregnancy Speculation 'Nothing hides a bump better than a muumuu dress,' an insider says.

Ben Affleck is planning to whisk his girlfriend Lindsay Shookus away to Hawaii to tie the knot, and sources tell RadarOnline.com it could be because they’re expecting!

“They want to do it before end of summer when Lindsay goes back to work on SNL,” an insider told Radar. “They love Hawaii and had a great time there in April when Ben was filming Triple Frontier.”

As Radar reported, Affleck, 45, and Shookus, 38, spent a romantic vacation in the aloha state earlier this year. They were spotted kayaking and taking a dip in the ocean. A return visit for a secret wedding could be next.

“Ben’s talking luau, leis and Hawaiian shirts,” the source said about any upcoming nuptial plans. “He’s already asked Jen [Garner] to watch the kids while he’s away.”

Affleck recently took the big step of meeting his girlfriend’s parents in Santa Monica. The Justice League star also has been sucking up to Shookus’ five-year-old daughter for good measure.

“People suspect the sense of urgency is because Lindsay’s pregnant,” the source confessed. “And nothing hides a bump better than a muumuu dress.”

Affleck shares children Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6, with estranged wife Garner.
