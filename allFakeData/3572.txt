O.J. Simpson Desperate To Date Kris Jenner When Out of Prison — Report

O.J. Simpson is eligible for parole in just one year and it turns out his first order of business will be to find Kris Jenner and date her! Do you think he has a chance?

O.J. Simpson has the hots for Kris Jenner. The former NFL star is currently serving time in prison for armed robbery and battery but his time in prison is possibly coming to an end. Now that O.J. is about to be up for a parole and a new report claims he wants to date the famous momager because he’s “always had a crush on her.”

He’s supposedly been pining for her while behind bars and his crush goes back 30 years. “O.J. has had a crush on Kris forever,” Ian Halperin, author of Kardashian Dynasty: The Controversial Rise of America’s Royal Family told The Sun. “He believes the relationship that Kris is in now with Corey Gamble is a sham. He believes he is the man for her and intends to pursue her when he gets out of prison,” Halperin continued. “There is definitely a long history there.” But the report claims that is O.J. is unable to date Kris, he wants to date Caitlyn Jenner! “O.J. is obsessed with Caitlyn,” he claims. “He is struck by how she has captured the hearts of the world and said with a straight face, ‘When I get out of here I would consider dating her too’.”

But it also turns out that O.J. has his sights set on KUWTK! “O.J. definitely has a plan when he gets out of prison and he intends to be around the Kardashians,” Ian said. “He is going to pitch to them about getting a spot on the show. He is broke, he needs money and he feels his only chance to get back on TV — which is his dream — is to hook up with his old ‘family.’”

HollywoodLifers, do you think O.J. has a chance with Kris?
