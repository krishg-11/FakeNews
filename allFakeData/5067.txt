Khloe Kardashian ditches Tristan Thompson’s name from anniversary card

The speculation into Khloe Kardashian’s relationship with Tristan Thompson has hit an all-time high after she failed to sign his name on an anniversary card sent to sister Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.

Keeping Up With The Kardashians fans were under the impression the pair were trying to patch up their relationship after he was accused of cheating on his then-pregnant girlfriend with up to five different women.

But despite a bunch of rumours suggesting otherwise, it looks like the 33-year-old hasn’t been anywhere near as quick to forgive the NBA player as most people first thought: “Happy anniversary Kimye. Love always wins!! Love KoKo and True,” the message reads.

Just yesterday, Khloe shared a cryptic passage on Instagram that implied fate will reward her for how she’s handled the past few months: “Something you've been praying for is about to happen for you. You've had enough lessons. You've been patient long enough.”

It’s no secret that the Kardashian-Jenner gang aren’t exactly Tristan’s number one fans, with an insider telling E!: “Khloe just avoids talking about him and doesn't bring him up. She knows they don't approve and its extremely uncomfortable to bring anything up."

And while the same source said that Koko is “happy” in their relationship, a separate insider told Us Weekly that their romance is on shaky ground rn and that the pair are finding it difficult to leave the cheating ordeal in the past and move forwards as a couple.
