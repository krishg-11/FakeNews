Multiple sources tell Page Six that Megyn Kelly is now gunning for Matt Lauer’s job with the top “Today” host out.

Kelly, who hosts the 9 a.m. hour of NBC’s “Today,” also offered herself as a role model for younger female staffers at NBC News who may be weighing sexual-harassment claims.

After discussing her own experiences with reporting misconduct at Fox News during the Business Insider Ignition conference on Wednesday, Kelly told the crowd: “Let me tell you, if a woman came to me at NBC News and said this has happened to me . . . A.) I would advise her on what to do and B.) I would work it behind the scenes, even if I had to go into the boss’ office and say, ‘Here’s a name, go investigate, you have to do some sort of looking. I’m not going to tell you who reported it. I don’t have to.’”

Kelly said: “I think powerful women need to be there for less powerful women so they can grow into powerful women, so they’re not scared out of the workforce or effectively shoved out.”

An insider insisted that Kelly does not want Lauer’s role.

Speakers at the conference included Richard Plepler, David Zaslav, Jeff Zucker, Jodi Kantor and Janice Min.
