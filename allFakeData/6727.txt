Martin Landau, perhaps most known for his Oscar-winning performance as Bela Lugosi in 1994’s Ed Wood, died Saturday at age 89. Celebrities influenced by Landau’s many decades of work — his first notable role was in Alfred Hitchcock’s 1959 film North by Northwest and he has been acting ever since — reacted to the news, remembering his talent and kindness.

“I had the honor & joy of working/playing with Marty Landau. What a wonderful actor, what a wonderful soul,” Jeff Bridges wrote on Twitter. “He loved acting so much, and that love, that excitement was contagious. Thank you, Marty, for all you gave us.”

“Working with Martin Landau on Ed Wood was a joy,” Patricia Arquette tweeted. “What a talented, sweet generous actor. #RealDeal.”

Orlando Jones posted a portrait Landau drew for him. “He took me under wing,” Jones wrote. “He touched my heart. I swore to pay it forward.”
