Nicole Kidman Gets Honest About Her Best Beauty Looks

And if there's one thing that Kidman says she's more vigilant about now than ever, it's sun protection . She told us last year that she always makes a point of teaching her kids — and her husband, Keith Urban — about the importance of sunscreen , so it makes perfect sense that she's partnered with Neutrogena on the brand's latest "Every day is SUNday" campaign . (Because if Kidman can spend hours in the California sun filming season two of Big Little Lies and not destroy her skin, you can avoid a sunburn after a day at the beach.)
