Celebrities react to superstar Glen Campbell's death

Glen Campbell, the country music legend and original “Rhinestone Cowboy,” died Tuesday at age 81 after suffering from Alzheimer’s disease for several years. He leaves behind over 50 studio albums, dozens of songs that crossed over onto the pop charts, and five No. 1 country hits — EW rounded up his most startling musical moments — as well as his family and many friends in the entertainment industry.

“Thank you Glen Campbell,” Charlie Daniels Band’s titular frontman tweeted, “for sharing your talent with us for so many years. May you rest in peace my friend. You will never be forgotten.”

Ashley Campbell, the superstar’s daughter and fellow recording artist, said that she was “heartbroken.” “I owe him everything I am, and everything I ever will be,” she tweeted. “He will be remembered so well and with so much love.”
