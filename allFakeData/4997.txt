Kendall Jenner's 20 Best 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' Moments

Kendall Jenner has spent nearly half of her life on camera. She was just 11 when her family’s TV show hit the airwaves in 2007, which means that almost every awkward moment of her life is also featured in an episode on E! We’ve watched her blossom from a little kid whose main function was to serve as comedic relief for sister’s onscreen exploits to the graceful, calm, and collected supermodel she is today.

While the Kardashian sisters are zany, outspoken, and uber-glam, Kendall’s always been a bit more grounded in real life. When she speaks, she’s to the point — dare we say she’s wise beyond her years? Kendall has a knack for hitting the nail on head when it comes to being real. What would the show be without her confessional reality checks and one-liners?

In that spirit, we rounded up some of Kendall’s wisest, most matter-of-fact moments. Feel free to use them when you need to channel your inner smart-ass supermodel.
