Inside the marriage of Beyoncé and Jay-Z, who sport matching ring finger tattoos, weathered a cheating scandal, and are worth over $1 billion

• Beyoncé and Jay Z are music industry titans who've been married since 2008.

• The couple's net worth is estimated to be about $1.16 billion.

• The pair now have three children: Blue Ivy, and twins Rumi and Sir.

Beyoncé and Jay-Z have united to collaborate on DJ Khaled's latest track "Top Off," along with Future.

They've been a match made in musical heaven ever since they first collaborated on the song "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" back in 2002.

Tabloids were quick to speculate whether or not the duo had more than a professional relationship. But even after they tied the knot in 2008, the couple has largely kept quiet about their romance.

But that doesn't mean it's always been smooth sailing for the "Crazy in Love" couple.

In an interview with New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet, Jay-Z opened up about his infidelity, which Beyoncé alluded to in her acclaimed visual album Lemonade.

"You shut down all emotions," the rapper told Baquet. "So even with women, you gonna shut down emotionally, so you can't connect... In my case, like it's, it's deep. And then all the things happen from there: infidelity."

Jay-Z went on to reveal the couple used their craft "like a therapy session," making music together in order to heal. The sessions ultimately resulted in reconciliation, along with Lemonade and Jay-Z's album 4:44.

Here's a look back on the relationship of Jay-Z and Beyoncé:
