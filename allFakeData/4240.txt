Actor Ethan Hawke, who co-starred with Shepard in Snow Falling on Cedars (1999) and Hamlet (2000), remembered the deceased in a statement: ‚ÄúHe was a poet of the first order. I‚Äôve acted in many of his plays and directed ‚ÄúA Lie of the Mind.‚Äù He played my father twice on film. Some days he could be irascible. At other times he could be profoundly wise and kind. He was the writer any serious American actor of my generation cut their teeth on. It is a gross understatement to say, he will be missed.‚Äù
