Leonardo DiCaprio Is Rumored To Do This Lazy AF Thing During Sex

Apparently, Leo is a lion in the bedroom... not.

Star magazine reported that during sex, Leonardo DiCaprio lies back, puts on headphones and lets the girl do all the work.

I can't confirm that any of it is true, but I really want it to be.

A source claims that her best friend slept with Leo. The friend calls Leo "selfish, lazy and downright rude.‚Äù Here's what else she said her friend told her about the bedroom experience,

She told me that during the act, Leo put on headphones and even started vaping! Then he signaled her to keep going while he just laid back and zoned out.

Ouch. Leo's sex partner supposedly felt very embarrassed because Leo was just, oh, you know, casually listening to some MGMT while she "carried on." Hey, I'd feel embarrassed too. I'd be all like, AM I NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU, LEO?! and throw things at his beautiful head. Then I'd cry.

Another insider is convinced Leo would do something like this, saying,

Leo knows women are mesmerized by his stardom, so he obviously doesn't care at all whether they're satisfied or not. He can sleep with almost any woman he wants without even trying, so it's no surprise he doesn't try in bed either.

LOL. I feel that. Leonardo DiCaprio is one of my favorite actors, so I really hope this story is true. He may only date models and behave like a total a-hole, but his supposed bedroom etiquette is kind of amazing. You do you, Leo.
