The long goodbye: Irina Shayk gives Bradley Cooper a farewell kiss before leaving London

The loved-up pair put on a major display of affection as they bid each other an emotional farewell after spending a few days together in the capital.

Bradley, 40, is currently in the UK ahead of his stint in The Elephant Man at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, which kicks off next week.

Clearly smitten, the blossoming couple couldn't keep their hands off of each other.

Both seemed relaxed and happy, and Irina opted for a casual look in a black sweater and leggings as she hugged her beau.
