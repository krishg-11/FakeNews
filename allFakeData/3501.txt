Kourtney Kardashian blasts pregnant sister Khloé in new ep of 'KUWTK'

Video from the upcoming season finale of Keeping Up with the Kardashians reveals the sisters argument during a trip to San Francisco with Kim Kardashian West.



The video shows, Kim, 37, and Khloé, 33, take in the view during a private Alcatraz boat tour, while Kourtney, 38, is talking on the phone. When she suddenly interjects to try to point something out, Khloé snaps.

“What the f— are you here for?” she scolds. “Don’t chime in if you’re not going to get off your f—ing phone call all the time. You’re like, a waste of space in my meter right now.”



“You’re annoying as f— now when we’re together,” she adds. “This is what you do. You’re on your phone the whole time. You’re just not present!”



“We’re only here once,” says Khloé. “When are we ever going to go back to Alcatraz? You know what? Actually, I’m not doing this today. I’m not doing this today, because last time in Costa Rica, I looked crazy because I’m always the one complaining to get you guys to have fun. I’m not going to be crazy, okay? You’ll be the f—ing bitch that you need to be.”



“Good. F— you, you f—ing whore,” Kourtney retorts, adding, “Pregnant wh***!”
