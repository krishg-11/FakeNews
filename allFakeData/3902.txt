Selena Gomez & Justin Theroux May Be More Than Just Friends

Following very public breakups, longtime-acquaintances-turned friends Selena Gomez and Justin Theroux have reportedly become romantically involved.

According to Wednesday's initial reports from Life & Style, the 25-year-old "Bad Liar" singer and the 46-year-old ex-husband of Jennifer Aniston have recently "become closer than ever."

"They've known each other for years through their manager," an insider explained to the publication, adding that their shared experience of both going through headline-breaking splits has pushed the pair closer. "Initially, they leaned on each other for emotional support after going through messy breakups," the sourced continued.



It's all simply speculation—no confirmation has come from Gomez, Theroux or either of their reps—though Life & Style's source adds fuel to the gossip by suggesting that Jennifer Aniston, "is not happy" about the rumored love connection between her Theroux and Gomez, her former husband of two years and friend, respectively.

There's certainly truth that Gomez and Theroux have been spending some time together. In early May, the two were spotted together in New York City, on a group outing with a whole crew of A-list pals, including Paul Rudd and his wife Julie Yaeger, Rooney Mara, and photographer friend to both Gomez and Theroux, Petra Collins.

Like Gomez, Collins has also been linked to The Leftovers star, with romance rumors following shortly after Theroux and Aniston's public breakup back in February. But more recent reporting suggests that the pair are strictly platonic.

Due to the gaping 21-year age difference between Gomez and Theroux, it's likely that The Leftovers star and the "Fetish" singer are no more than friends—but in the small world of Hollywood, crazier things have happened.
