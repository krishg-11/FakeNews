John Mayer Using Breakup Song To Win Katy Perry Back?: He’s Been Calling Her

John Mayer recently got super candid and revealed that his new song, ‘Still Feel Like Your Man,’ is all about his ex, Katy Perry. The emotional track makes it very clear that he’s missing his ex big time. So, is he going hard to get her back? Here’s what we know!

Katy Perry, 32, and John Mayer, 39, had a very intense — and tumultuous — relationship. They dated on and off from August 2012 until they finally split for good in 2015. Katy moved on to Orlando Bloom, 40, and it seemed like John was history. But a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that John has never given up on winning her back.

“John was practically jumping for joy when he found out about her breakup with Orlando,” says our source. “Since then he’s been bombarding her with calls and flowers. He’s written her poetry and songs, getting her back is all her cares about these days.” So sweet!

John has a history of going hot and cold on Katy so we’re not surprised that she hasn’t gone running straight back to him. But his new song ‘Still Feel Like Your Man’ has got to be pulling at her heart strings a little. With lyrics like “I still keep your shampoo in my shower, in case you want to wash your hair” and “Still think I’m never going to find another you,” the song is a serious tear jerker.

But John isn’t stopping with love songs and flowers, he’s also started talking babies! The sexy singer just opened up to The New York Times and revealed that he’s ready to settle down and have a family. “That’s the final frontier, man,” he admitted. We love that John is finally growing up — but only time will tell if Katy’s willing to give him another chance.

HollywoodLifers, do you think Katy should take John back? Or will he break her heart all over again? Let us know in the comments!
