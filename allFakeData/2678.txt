Katie Holmes Finally Breaks Silence Over Jamie Foxx Split Rumours

Move along, there's nothing to see here...

Katie Holmes' people have dismissed 'untrue' rumours that she has split with long-term partner Jamie Foxx.

A representative told People: 'The Radar story is 100 percent untrue.'

The tabloid story in question alleged that Holmes and the Oscar-winning actor had been planning a wedding, but called it off and then split due to 'trust issues'.

The very private couple have been dating since 2013, after they were spotted dancing together at the Hamptons a year after the Dawson Creek star's highly-publicised separation from Tom Cruise.

The pair have avoided attending events where they might be photographed together, but did sit next to each other at at Clive Davisâ€™s Pre-Grammy Awards Gala earlier this year in January. Holmes, 38, and Foxx, 50, looked very happy together - and just look at the way the actress is gazing at her boyfriend.

Holmes also helped the actor celebrated his recent 50th, and the duo were seen arriving together at Paramount Pictures for his party.

Speaking previously about keeping his relationships out of the spotlight, he told ET: 'I like to stay quiet, you know, with anyone that dating; that I'm really, really dating.

'I feel like this... if there's somebody that you're dating, the worst thing you can do is let that [points at camera] touch you. Because once that camera touches you, [it's out]. ... Yeah, we don't take time to do that [make sure the relationship is real] in Hollywood anymore.'
