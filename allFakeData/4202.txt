Justin Bieber Did NOT Attend Vanity Fair Oscars After Party

Justin Bieber did NOT attend the Vanity Fair Oscars after-party, nor did he turn up to the event dressed in casual clothing, despite a manufactured report. Gossip Cop can exclusively correct this claim. We’re told it’s “not true.”

“Justin Bieber Shows Up To Oscars Party Underdressed & With His Pants Falling Down,” reads a headline from HollywoodLife, which goes on to claim the singer completely defied “the dress code at one of the most high-profile public events of the year.” After Bieber was pictured wearing casual attire, the often disproven site claims, “[Bieber] opted to keep things a bit more casual. He literally wore light denim jeans, a sweater and sneakers.” “It’s pretty safe to say he stuck out like a sore thumb inside the glamorous party,” further contends the webloid.
