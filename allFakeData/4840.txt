Meghan Markle Prince Harry Wedding: Meghan Markle a 'nervous wreck' before royal wedding, rumours claim

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle

It was recently announced that Meghan Markle’s father, Thomas Markle, will not be attending his daughter’s royal wedding on May 19. Reports claim that Thomas Markle is recovering in a hospital after a recent heart surgery and has been advised to rest. Meanwhile, according to a report in Radaronline, the condition of her father coupled with the pressure of the wedding has left Meghan a ‘nervous wreck’.

“All of this stuff with her dad is extremely bothersome but she is just so relieved that he is okay,” a source close to Meghan told the publication.

However, thankfully for Meghan, her mother Doria Ragland arrived in London on Wednesday to be by her side. “Meghan would not be able to handle all of this stress without her mom there,” the source said, adding, “Doria is one of the most grounded women ever and can calm Meghan down more than anyone.”

The report also adds that Prince Harry is least bothered about the tensions in Meghan’s family. “Harry isn’t bothered at all by all of this drama that is going on with her family and told her he doesn’t care about any of it. She feels like she is letting him down and he assured her that it is not the case,” an insider was quoted as saying.
