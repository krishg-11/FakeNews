Armie Hammer disses James Woods for denouncing gay romance Call Me By Your Name

Armie Hammer is firing back after actor James Woods claimed Hammer’s critically acclaimed gay romance film Call Me By Your Name “chips away the last barriers of decency.”

Based on André Aciman’s 2007 novel, Luca Guadagnino’s intimate romance follows a teenager in Italy (Timothée Chalamet, 21) who strikes up a relationship with his father’s 24-year-old academic assistant (Hammer, 31). On Saturday, Woods retweeted a tweet that criticized the age gap between the two characters, to which Hammer responded: “Didn’t you date a 19-year-old when you were 60…….?”

Woods was 59 when he reportedly started dating 19-year-old girlfriend Ashley Madison. They split after more than six years of dating; in 2013, the 66-year-old Woods began dating 20-year-old Kristen Bauguess.

Call Me By Your Name debuted earlier this year to glowing reviews at the Sundance Film Festival and will hit theaters Nov. 24.

“I can’t think of another movie where two men are so openly and honestly with each other,” Hammer told EW earlier this summer. “We made a movie that’s so tender and enjoyable, it can bridge gaps.”
