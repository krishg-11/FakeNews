Does the cast of "The Big Bang Theory" get along?

No , i have watched all the interviews and bloopers and everything else there is and trust me many of the characters dont like each other. All the behind the scene bloopers are just a way of the creators promoting the show and showing the characters in a good light.

In actual these are the problems that the cast have
