Roseanne Barr begs Jerry Seinfeld for career comeback help

Roseanne Barr is well aware that fellow sitcom legend Jerry Seinfeld has a soft spot for cursed comedians, and RadarOnline.com has learned exclusively the disgraced comedy queen is now begging him to help her out of her current mess.

“Jerry’s word carries a lot of weight in Hollywood,” an insider told Radar. “He’s respected for being generous, honest and kind.”

Seinfeld has famously stood by a few fellow funnymen who’ve found themselves on the blacklist, like co-star Michael Richards and Louis CK. Now a source tells Radar exclusively Barr is asking Seinfeld to consider having her as guest on his show Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee.

“She wants to give her side of the story in a casual setting and reassure people she’s not the pariah she’s made out to be.”

As Radar readers are well aware, Barr faced a swift comeuppance after her racist Twitter rant in May. The hit revival of her show was immediately cancelled, and a reboot minus the controversial comedian will replace it.

In June, Seinfeld came to Barr’s defense, telling ET “I didn’t see why it was necessary to fire her.

“Why would you murder someone who’s committing suicide?” he asked, then added, “But I never saw someone ruin their entire career with one button push. That was fresh.”

The support from one of the country’s most beloved comedians has helped Barr as she tries to recover her reputation.

“She really appreciated the way Jerry stuck up for her and said she shouldn’t have been fired,” the source said. “That’s given her hope.”
