Original, 1/24: Kim Kardashian welcomed her third child Chicago West via surrogate just last Monday—and already, it would seem, she and Kanye West are thinking of expanding their family once more. People reports that Kardashian wants her surrogate to carry her fourth child for her. “Even before Chicago was born, Kim was talking about asking the surrogate to carry her next baby,” a source tells People. “She’s so happy with the whole process and thrilled with the surrogate."

“Kim definitely wants more kids," the source added. "She is so happy being a family of five. She wants the family to get even bigger!”

Kardashian wrote about her experience with her surrogate when she announced Chicago’s birth on her site. "We are incredibly grateful to our surrogate who made our dreams come true with the greatest gift one could give and to our wonderful doctors and nurses for their special care," Kardashian said. "North and Saint are especially thrilled to welcome their baby sister."
