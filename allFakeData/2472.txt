The Internet's Most Savage Reactions to Kylie Jenner Naming Her Daughter Stormi

Kylie Jenner took the internet by storm when she announced the name of her new baby girl.

On Tuesday afternoon, the 20-year-old reality star shared the first photo of her baby girl holding her finger. She captioned the Instagram shot, "Stormi."

Kim Kardashian followed the photo up with a tweet of her own, confirming the name with a simple emoji:

Kylie and Travis Scott welcomed their baby girl at Cedars-Sinani in Los Angeles on Thursday, Feb. 1, the same hospital Kylie's nieces and nephews were born.

After keeping her pregnancy completely under wraps for 9 months, Kylie confirmed the news on Sunday before the Super Bowl, calling it "the most beautiful, empowering, and life changing experience I've had in my entire life."

Unfortunately for Kylie, Twitter seems to think her baby's name sounds a bit like the name of the porn star President Donald Trump may or may not have paid to keep quiet, Stormy Daniels. Others are cracking jokes about a Kardahian/Jenner family's weather-releated names, writing things like, "It's going to be Stormi, with a chance of Reign, in the North of Chicago."

Conspiracy Theory: Kylie had her baby last month before the Stormy Daniels story broke. She wouldn't name her baby after a porn star who publicly slept with Donald Trump. Right, guys? Please. pic.twitter.com/W4jAJegvlW — Sophie Vershbow (@svershbow) February 6, 2018

It's so 2018 that we now have to deal with multiple spellings of the name Stormy/Stormi. — Louis Peitzman (@LouisPeitzman) February 6, 2018

I CAN’T BELIEVE #KYLIEJENNER NAMED HER DAUGHTER AFTER DONALD TRUMP’S PORN STAR MISTRESS. #Stormi — Allison Cacich (@AllisonCacich) February 6, 2018

Kim K better watch her back... you’re niece has broken the internet twice in the whole 6 days she’s been alive #stormi — Kennedy Robinson (@kennedy1812) February 6, 2018

Y'all Kylie Jenner's baby name Stormi happens to the same name as the porn star who fucked the President Of The United States. This is getting more media than DACA & a potential government shutdown.



Welcome to 2018 aka HELL.

“Stormi” is a name you give your kid when you’re confident you’ll always ne so rich they’ll never have to get a job — erin ryan (@morninggloria) February 6, 2018

I don’t know why everyone is so surprised Kylie named her baby Stormi. It deadass wasn’t going to be called something boring like Brenda. — Jack Binstead (@JackBinstead) February 6, 2018
