10% of fish across sushi restaurants not as labelled

Sushi restaurants, supermarkets and grocers are mislabelling fish and could even be serving up threatened species, a study has found.

A tenth of fish products across 31 sushi bars and restaurants were not as labelled.

Some 3.3 per cent of fish sold by supermarkets, which have sophisticated tracing systems, are not what they seem.

And research of grocery shops and markets found fish labelled as red snapper, a tropical fish used in Caribbean cooking, was actually redfish, a cold water Atlantic species.

Some labelled as mackerel turned out to be either Indian mackerel, which is found in the Red Sea and Polynesia, or hilsa shad, a type of tropical herring mostly found around in the Indian Ocean.

Professor Stefano Mariani, of Salford University, who presented the evidence at the Fisheries Society of the British Isles Symposium, said: ‘This is about transparency. People don’t know what they are buying.

‘There is now a huge trade in lesser-known species that have not been assessed.

‘We are talking about hundreds of species of fish.’
