Beyonce Is An 'ABSOLUTE DIVA' . . . She Invited EVERYONE To Her Mansion . . . And IGNORED ALL HER GUESTS!!!

Here's what Star Magazine is reporting:

Beyonce was the hostess with the mostess as she annoyed guests during a recent dinner at her palatial Bel Air pad. Sources say that she kept 30 VIP guests - and her hangry hubby, Jay-Z - waiting for over an hour as she got a foot massage!

"Instead of greeting her friends Beyonce relaxed in nearby room as two women rubbed and scrubbed her tootsies," tattles a tipster.

"Jay looked like steam was going to start coming out of his ears. Finally he ordered the staff to start serving his starving guests."
