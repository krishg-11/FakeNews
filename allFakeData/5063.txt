Brad Pitt Calls Himself a ‘Miserable Bastard’ and ‘Loner’ in British ‘GQ’

On behalf of loners and miserable bastards everywhere, welcome to our esteemed club, Brad Pitt

In the November issue of British GQ, the A-lister opened up about his semi-charmed kind of life.

The actor, who’s been shying away from the limelight in past years, admitted that he’s been “slowing down for a while” and “transitioning to other things.” “I do want to spend more time with my kids before they’re grown up and gone,” he explained.

But maybe you’re taking this whole “slowing down” thing a bit too far if George Clooney calls you “unreachable.” Come on Brad, you can’t play George Clooney like that! Just send the man a text or a Snapchat every now and then!

When asked to comment on his friend’s description, Brad Pitt answered, “Well, you know, George is extremely accessible. He’s one of our best representatives. He’s funny as shit. He’s a joy to be around.”

“I guess maybe I’m more of a miserable bastard,” he quipped. “I’m a bit of a loner you know? I’m more quiet by nature. And coming from, you know, hillbilly country, I’m probably more reserved.”

So you’re telling me that being married to AngelinaJolie and sequestered with your beautiful brood of children in a French chateau is not a winning formula for eternal happiness? Is there any hope for the rest of us??

“I’ve always believed happiness is overrated, you know?” Pitt continued. “It’s those difficult times that inform the next wonderful time, and it’s a series of trade-offs, of events, of wins and losses.”
