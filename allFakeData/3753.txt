Kardashian Family Donating $500,000 to Hurricane Harvey Relief Efforts

"Houston we are praying for you!"

As rain continues to pour down on southeast Texas and the devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey -- now a tropical storm -- becomes more clear, the Kardashian family is stepping up to join the ranks of celebrities supporting flood relief in the region.

On Tuesday (Aug. 29), Kim Kardashian West, Kris Jenner and Khloe Kardashian announced they and the rest of the Keeping Up With the Kardashians clan would be donating $500,000 to the American Red Cross and Salvation Army USA.

The generous act was apparently -- at least in part -- prompted by a public plea Kevin Hart made over the weekend and has been pushing since, asking his fellow celebrities to contribute what they can.

"We have been watching the heartbreaking footage of the catastrophic flooding in Houston," Jenner said on Twitter. "Our hearts go out to the people of Texas."
