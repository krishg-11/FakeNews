John Travolta had six-year gay affair with me, California pilot Doug Gotterba alleges in report that actor's camp calls 'ridiculous'

"He'd show up on my door many times, unannounced, to check up on me," the pilot told the Enquirer. "He'd disappear into my bedroom and go through my drawers. He always tried to catch me cheating on him."
