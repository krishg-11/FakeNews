Celine Dion 'The Voice' Diva As Gwen Stefani Mentor

Celine Dion Throws Diva Fit On ‘The Voice’ 'She acted like a superstar the moment she walked on set!'

The set of The Voice is filled with superstar singers, but an insider told RadarOnline.com that Celine Dion set a new record for diva behavior when she guest-starred as Gwen Stefani’s mentor.

“Celine acted like she was a superstar the moment she walked on set to tape her episodes,” a show insider told Radar.

“She was extremely entitled and was just not friendly or welcoming to the production crew at all!”

“She got the royal treatment and, of course, brought an entire entourage of people with her,” the source claimed. “She had to do several retakes and complained about everything from her hair and make-up, to the outfit that was chosen for her.”

But as Radar reported, Dion and Stefani pairing up was a perfect match, as Blake Shelton’s blonde lady love is also acting like a diva this season, an insider claimed.

“Gwen used to be everyone’s favorite and now a lot of people can’t stand her because sometimes she acts like she owns the show and they are lucky to have her,” an insider previously told Radar.

The Voice airs Mondays and Tuesdays at 8/7c on ABC.
