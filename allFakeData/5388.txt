The Real Reason Kendall Jenner Has Stepped Back From The Spotlight

Watch to find out why!

"All the stress has become too much for her," an insider revealed to OK!. "She wants to focus on herself."

The 22-year-old has opened up about suffering from "debilitating anxiety" in the past. "I literally wake up in the middle of the night with a full-on panic attacks," she told friend Cara Delevigne for Harper's Bazaar.

Her anxiety has gotten so bad, in fact, Kendall didn't walk at any of the spring Fashion Week shows.

"Kendall hates traveling," the insider said, "[and] she's upset about her acne. Plus she feels snubbed by other models who are jealous of her success." (She's also felt insecure about up-and-coming star Kaia Gerber.)

The oldest Jenner sister is now reevaluating her whole life, including her romance with 29-year-old NBA star Blake Griffin. Their relationship is part of the reason Kendall feels overwhelmed. Blake's ex dragged the model into the couple's custody battle and she "was mortified," the insider said. "She tries to keep her dating life quiet, so she felt so exposed. It must be lonely for her."
