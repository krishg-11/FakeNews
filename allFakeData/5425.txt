Live stream: Trump's lawyer responds to James Comey testimony

USA TODAY

Speaking publicly for the first time since his abrupt firing, former FBI director James Comey told a Senate panel Thursday that he took President Trump's words as "a direction" to drop the investigation of ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn's ties to Russia. President Trump's attorney Marc Kasowitz will deliver comments at the National Press Club.

Comey confirmed Wednesday that President Trump requested his loyalty and later urged him to drop the investigation into ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn, according to a preview of his opening statement. Comey describes one meeting at the White House in which he said Trump strongly defended Flynn, saying that his former national security adviser “hadn’t done anything wrong’’ in his prior contact with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go,’’ Comey said, quoting the president. “He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.’’
