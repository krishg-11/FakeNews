There’s no bad blood between Vampire Diaries stars Nina Dobrev and Ian Somerhalder.

Dobrev – who is exiting the supernatural CW series after Thursday’s finale – told E! News she’s thrilled her ex-boyfriend found love with Nikki Reed. (The couple tied the knot April 26 in Malibu, California.)

“When I heard about the wedding, I thought it was beautiful. They look happy, and I am happy, and so I don’t see why there should be a problem with that,” Dobrev said. “The drama is in the media, it’s not with us. But, of course, we’re on a teen drama show, everyone’s going to look for drama. If there’s no drama, there’s nothing to write about. I just ignore it.”

Dobrev, 26, and Somerhalder, 36, split in 2013 after about three years together.

“I love him, and the friendship is still strong, and I think he’s great, and I care about him,” she said. “And that didn’t change. Yes, we’re professional, and that’s fine. We were friends long before we dated, and we still are now.”
