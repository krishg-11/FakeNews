US report: George and Amal’s ‘$1 billion divorce announcement’

Since welcoming twins Ella and Alexander last June, George has gushed about parenthood and the 'love you gain' after having children.

He said 'when you have children of your own, you realise you are responsible for their lives in a way you haven't been before, and you become conscious that you want to make an example of your own life that they will follow.'

However, Star claims that George is not taking his role as a father seriously enough.

'Amal has told him over and over not to ride scooters, but he refuses!' says the source, who adds that she 'blew up at him after the accident but he kind of smiled and shrugged it off.'

The source claims that while Amal was by George's side shortly after the accident, helping him onto a private plane leaving Sardinia, she's since left - and has taken the twins with her.

'She's telling friends she hopes the absence helps make him see things her way.'

'Amal is pretty clear about what she expects from George as a father and a husband,' says an insider, who adds that while Amal hasn't filed divorce papers, she's 'privately consulted a lawyer', Star's source explosively alleges.

George and Amal are yet to respond to Star's report.
