Archbishop Desmond Tutu dies while holidaying in Texas

HOUSTON, TEXAS – Anti-apartheid and human rights activist Archbishop Desmond Tutu has died in Texas at the age of 86.

His wife Leah Tutu told reporters that the couple were in Texas for holiday and had plans of greeting George H.W Bush who lost his wife few days ago.

According to Leah Tutu, Desmond Tutu was rushed to hospital in the wee hours of Saturday morning where he passed on. The cause of his death is not immediately known.

In August 2016, Tutu’s daughter Thandeka Tutu-Gxashe he was in the hospital for treatment of a recurring infection.

Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe may have described him as “evil”, but Archbishop Desmond Tutu remained a much-loved figure across the world – principally for his role in South Africa’s struggle against apartheid.

During the long years that Nelson Mandela was in prison, Archbishop Tutu spoke out against the regime – and won the Nobel peace prize in 1984 for his efforts.

He was chosen by President Mandela to chair South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission and investigate the crimes committed by all sides during the apartheid regime.

Before his demise, “the Arch” – as he was known – had remained irrepressible and influential both in his native South Africa and on the global political stage.

He was chairman of a group of former world leaders called The Elders, launched on Nelson Mandela’s 89th birthday in 2007 with the aim of tackling some of the world’s most pressing problems.
