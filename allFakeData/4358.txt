Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are 'INFATUATED' and 'still getting to know each other'

Speaking in an exclusive interview with the Express.co.uk, Tracey Cox, a body language and relationships expert and TV presenter, claimed the Meghan and Harry are still getting to know each other two months after marriage.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were married on May 19 in a romantic ceremony at St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle – less than two years after it is rumoured the pair met in the summer of 2016.

Ms Cox told Express.co.uk: “They got married right in the middle of the honeymoon period when your brain is just flooded by love and sexual hormones and your judgement is completely skew.

"And now, anyone looking at them can tell they are absolutely smack bang in the middle, they are infatuated, they are at the lust stage, they are that wonderful stage everyone wants to stay at."
