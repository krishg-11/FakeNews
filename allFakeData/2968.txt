The Twilight Curse: Will Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart Ever Be Taken Seriously?

Call it the curse we're totally guilty of...

Ya know? The evil spell forever connecting Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart to their Edward and Bella counterparts—especially when each half of our favorite twosome has been killing it in a slew of new roles.

Which, like, totally sucks for the darling duo since—dare we say—both Rob and Kris are A-list actors worthy of some award show recognition?

So, can the world (and Team Truth) move past this Twilight obsession?

And what's with Uma Thurman being the latest offender?
