Kourtney Kardashian was "on the verge of a mental breakdown" as her relationship with Scott Disick came to an end.

The reality TV star split from her partner of nearly a decade earlier this year, after she did everything she could to keep her family together.

In scenes filmed over summer for Keeping Up With The Kardashians - set to air next weekend - Kourtney opens up about the difficult situation for the first time.

As she cries to sister Kim, she says: "I've worked so hard to keep this family together.

"I'm on the verge of a mental breakdown."

A voiceover adds: "This is the end of Scott and Kourtney."

This month, Kourtney has been getting on with her life and spending time with her children after photos emerged of Scott relaxing with 18-year-old Lindsay Vrckovnic.

The mum-of-three - whose ex-boyfriend is believed to be dating the teen model - headed to the Underwood Family Farm for a Halloween-themed activity.

She was accompanied by her son Mason, five, and daughter Penelope, three, as well as niece North West .

The youngsters appeared to be having the time of their lives as they got stuck into all the action.
