Khloé Kardashian Is Boycotting FaceTime Because of Baby True and the Explanation Is Hilarious

At an event for the launch of her Good American activewear line this morning, Khloé Kardashian gushed about three-month-old daughter True, but said she's mad at her for the funniest reason.

When she's gone, she'll FaceTime the baby whenever, and apparently True isn't always into it.

"I do get annoyed because she doesn't give me any play time on FaceTime, she like doesn't really care about me," she told a panel at the event. There's a major double standard when she FaceTimes with her dad Tristan Thompson, she said.

"With her dad, she smiles, and her tongue sticks out, and it's like why can't you do the same thing with me? I'm protesting, I'm not going to FaceTime her," she joked.

She opened up to the panel about alllll the advice you get when you're about to become a mom, and she said it can be seriously overwhelming, especially when you're about to give birth.

"You get so much unsolicited advice that it drives you crazy, and you get really stressed out, but you're pregnant, you're nine months, and you're like, 'What is this? You're freaking me out. I'm already in this. I don't know what to do. There's no turning back.' And people just say the craziest things to you."

She said Kim is her go-to for advice, because she's not judgmental. She'll give the advice and then doesn't care if you use it or not. Kourtney, on the other hand, gives "side-eye" type mom advice, like when she told Khloé she shouldn't have a TV in her nursery. She wishes Kourtney would do the same thing as Kim.

"Educate me why I shouldn't have that, so I can decide [for myself]," she said.
