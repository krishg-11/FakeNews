Oprah Winfrey: The Butler, racism and Obama

Video

American broadcaster and actress Oprah Winfrey said there was a whole generation of racist people who were "born and bred and marinated" in racism who would never change their ways, but that would die out.

She spoke to the BBC's Will Gompertz while in the UK to promote her new film The Butler, in which she plays Gloria Gaines, the wife of a White House butler.
