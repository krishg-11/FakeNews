Daniel Craig’s No-Nudity Clause For James Bond

Daniel Craig will once again play superspy James Bond — but the 49-year- old Brit has added a new clause to his contract — no nudity!

“Daniel is still in great shape, but at the age of 49 he doesn’t think he needs to be showing as much skin as he has in the past,” a set spy told The National ENQUIRER‘s Rob Shuter.

“We are still going to see Bond shirtless and in tight swimming trunks, but the totally naked James that we saw in ‘Casino Royale’ in 2006 is a thing of the past!”

The 25th official Bond film will be Craig’s 5th turn as the iconic hero over a 12-year span, bringing him within one film and one year of Roger Moore‘s record time in the role.
