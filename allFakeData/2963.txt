ESPY Awards 2017: Complete Winners List

The worlds of entertainment and sports collided on Wednesday night when the ESPY Awards were handed out in Los Angeles.

Peyton Manning hosted the 25th annual event, which aired live at 8 p.m ET on ABC. The winners of the awards were chosen entirely through online voting.

Bill Murray appeared on stage to accept the best moment award on behalf of the Chicago Cubs, who won for the team's first World Series since 1908. Drinking champagne in honor of the Cubs, Murray joked that "108 years of waiting is hardly a 'moment.' This is the culmination of 108 years of momentum. Momentum by momentous men."

Also during the show, Michelle Obama presented the Arthur Ashe Courage Award to Special Olympics Founder Eunice Kennedy Shriver, Jon Stewart presented Master Sgt. Israel Del Toro with the Pat Tillman Award for Service, Bryan Cranston honored retired Los Angeles Dodgers announcer Vin Scully with the Icon Award, and New Orleans Saints superfan Jarrius “JJ” Robertson was honored with the Jimmy V Perseverance Award.

A complete list of winners is below.
