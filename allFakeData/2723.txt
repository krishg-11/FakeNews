Maddox's shock words to mum Ange: "I want to live with Brad"

The teenager, who was born in Cambodia said he’s done with living with Ange after she visited and prayed at the grave of Pol Pot, the murderous dictator who slaughter 3 million Cambodians.



‘Maddox must have been livid when he’d learned what his mother had done!” a source said to National Enquirer.



The source goes on to explain that as soon as Maddox heard what his mum had done, he called estranged dad, Brad begging to move in with him.





“Brad tried to soothe him, saying Angie is interested in the history of the country where she found Maddox,” the insider continued.



“He also explained that he needs to be careful while the pair’s lawyers work out custody of all their kids – and to hold tight until he could speak to her about it.



Back in 2016, it is alleged that Brad and Maddox got into a physical fight aboard a family fight, prompting Ange to file for divorce.



However, NE sources say that now Maddox has had a chance to see how Ange’s “bizarre behaviour ignited problems within the family,” he’s keen to reconnect with Brad.
