Chris Pratt Pushed By Pals To Date Jennifer Lawrence After Anna Faris Split

Chris Pratt barely waited a week after splitting from Anna Faris to take off his wedding ring — and now the actor’s close pals are pushing him to make a move on Jennifer Lawrence. “This is obviously a very delicate situation,” admits a source. “Jen is technically still dating Darren Aronofsky, but things between them don’t seem so good. This could be Chris’ chance!” As Star previously reported, there were whispers that Chris, 38, and Jen, 27, got a little too cozy while filming Passengers. “They both tried to pass it off as good acting, but I’m not sure anyone believed them, especially not Anna,” dishes the insider. “Chris’ friends are all placing bets on how long it will take before he’s with Jen.”
