Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber baby news

And now, sources say #JELENA could be expecting their first baby.

Friends of the loved-up duo tell this week’s Life & Style magazine that, following Selena’s recent health scare, (the singer underwent a kidney transplant earlier this year) they’re looking to get married and start as family as soon as possible.

Justin and Selena – who have dated on and off since 2009 - have apparently “discussed eloping,” according to a source.

“But now she wants a big wedding – the bigger the better. She wants a white dress, thousands of colourful roses and her very best friends for bridesmaids.”

Furthermore, the insider reveals the 24-year-old “could be pregnant already,” noting that she hasn’t been drinking lately.
