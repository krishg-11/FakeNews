Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston 'busted' over Aspen reunion

The US mag story everyone is talking about Star magazine

According to a cover story in US magazine Star today, Jen has allegedly been "caught out" planning a get together at the posh US ski destination with her ex Brad, amid the collapse of his marriage and published claims that her own union to actor Justin Theroux is supposedly on thin ice.

‘They’ve been growing closer ever since Jen reached out to Brad after his split from Ange,’ a source told Star. ‘Jen has been a real source of comfort and strength for Brad, and during their long talks, they realised just how strong their bond still is.’

The publication goes on to claim that the duo have arranged to meet up on a skiing break. While she will be accompanied by close friends, it seems there is room for Brad.

‘When Jen mentioned that she was planning to go skiing with friends in Aspen after New Year’s, a light bulb went off in Brad’s head,’ claims Star’s source. ‘He said he could fly over in his private jet and meet up with her there.

‘He pointed out that they could even hit the slopes together, since no one would recognise them in their ski masks, goggles and helmets. Jen thought it was genius.

The magazine claims that Jen has booked a $10,000 a night chalet featuring multiple fireplaces and hot tubs.

‘The trip is going to be a blast,’ claims the source, who adds, ‘I imagine Brad and Jen will steal private moments to they can have some emotional heart-to-hearts.’

Reps for both Brad and Jen have denied Star’s story, and Jen has long said how happy she is with husband Justin.
