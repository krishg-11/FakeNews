Jennifer Aniston is pregnant at 48 - US report

Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux are expecting their first child after 16 months of fertility treatments, according to a bombshell report published in US magazine Star today.

“Obviously, this is an absolute dream come true for Jen,” Star’s source reveals. “In fact, it’s nothing short of a miracle. Jen just turned 48 this month, and she and Justin both knew that at her age, the odds were against her getting pregnant. It’s such a blessing.”

The couple struggled to get pregnant on their own before trying IVF, claims the publication's insiders.

“Jen and Justin had talked about having kids from day one, and at first they tried to do it naturally,” the source says. “They were crushed when it became clear that she couldn’t get pregnant on her own, so they went to a fertility specialist.”

After several rounds of IVF, they finally got the good news in December, according to Star.

“They’ve been through so much heartache along the way, but now it seems their baby dreams have finally come true,” adds the source.

Jennifer has yet to comment on the report.
