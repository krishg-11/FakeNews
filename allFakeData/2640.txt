After splitting from Leonardo DiCaprio in May following a yearlong relationship, Nina Agdal is enjoying a fun summer season — and hanging out with pals.

The 25-year-old was recently spotted in New York City with Christie Brinkley‘s 22-year-old son, Jack Brinkley Cook. On Thursday, the pair were photographed spending a casual day together.

And on Sunday, Agdal was in Montauk with Jack and his sister, Sailor Brinkley Cook, to celebrate Sailor’s 19th birthday with their friends at The Surf Lodge ahead of the Fourth of July holiday.

“It’s nothing but a little fling,” sources tell PEOPLE. “It’s nothing serious.”

According to Page Six, which first reported the news, the duo were seen “smooching all over Montauk,” including Surf Lodge.

Reps for Agdal and Brinkley Cook did not comment.

Agdal and DiCaprio, who made his first public outing since the breakup at the Cannes Film Festival in May, had dated for a year after first being spotted at a New York City club in May 2016. Following their split, a source close to the actor told PEOPLE that he just wasn’t ready to take the next step.

“Leo thought Nina was a super cool girl,” said the source. “It almost seemed different this time because he was way more affectionate and public with her than he normally is, but his friends knew it wouldn’t last.”

Adding, “He’s not ready to settle down and just isn’t in the mindset to get married or have kids.”
