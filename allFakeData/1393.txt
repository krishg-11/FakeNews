Trey Gowdy Breaks His Silence After 2 Of His Investigators Are Found Tortured And Killed…

The two officials were reportedly on their way to deliver a search warrant on the Clinton Presidential library, when they were tortured and killed.

The particulars of the crime were incomplete but the one thing that was for sure was that whoever managed to do it, was clearly a professional since they allegedly left absolutely no clue behind. Trey Gowdy had nothing to comment about this, for safety reasons. However he reportedly released a statement from his office in which he was held up by United States Marshals for protection. “The incident in Arkansas is just the latest in a vast conspiracy to cover up crimes by one of the most corrupt families in human history. No, we have no evidence. There’s never any evidence. What we do have, however, is a mole. Someone inside my own committee cost those men their lives by leaking their travel plans. I intend to find out who that mole is and have them waterboarded as an enemy of the state until they give up their boss.” CLICK THE VIDEO BELOW:
