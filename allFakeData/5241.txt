Gwyneth Paltrow Scared As ‘Goop’ Competition Heats Up From Camila Alves & Matthew McConaughey

Camila Alves is sinking millions of her and husband Matthew McConaughey’s fortune into her lifestyle website, ‘Women of Today’ – and sources tell RadarOnline.com exclusively Gwyneth Paltrow’s feeling “threatened.”

“This is a horrible version of Goop as far as [Gwyneth] is concerned, and she’s steaming mad over it,” an insider told Radar.

The Brazilian model, who married McConaughey, in 2012, describes her website as an “online home for all women to visit, to lend support, to pick up some guidance, to be mentors, to laugh together, to know we are not alone in this journey, to share our stories our learnings and create a community in our sisterhood.”

“Camila’s site has been given a posh makeover catering to the rich and famous,” the insider revealed. “And the people she’s targeting are Goop’s target audience and even clients.”

Paltrow launched Goop as a “lifestyle brand” in September 2008. What started as a weekly newsletter blossomed into a web site, magazine, and pop up store. It was recently valued at $250 million dollars. But Alves ambitions could eat into Paltrow’s profits.

“Camila is working herself into the ground revamping everything and has sunk a ton of her and Matthew’s cash into this project. Gwyneth has seen a few pretenders, but this is by far the most competitive,” the source confessed. “It’s no wonder she’s threatened.”
