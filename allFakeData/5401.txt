Judy Garland died in London in June 1969. She was only 47 years old and died from a Barbiturate overdose. She dealt with addiction throughout most of her life and it affected her career and relationships, especially with her family. Judy had three kids, Liza Minelli, Lorna Luft and Joey Luft.

Reports are that Liza Minelli does not agree with the choice of Renee Zellweger to play her mother. She said in a Facebook post that it is untrue that she has met or bonded with Renee Zellweger. She said she does not approve of the upcoming film. What do you think about the fact that Judy’s daughter, Liza does not approve of the film?

I have never met nor spoken to Renee Zellweger… I don’t know how these stories get started, but I do not approve nor… Posted by Liza Minnelli on Thursday, June 14, 2018
