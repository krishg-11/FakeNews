Taylor Swift’s ‘We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together’ about Jake Gyllenhaal: report

"This guy walks in who is a friend of my ex's and starts talking about how he's heard we're going to get back together. And that was not the case," Swift told GMA. "So I start telling them the story: break up, get back together, break up, get back together — just, ugh, the worst! And I picked up the guitar and (songwriting partner Max Martin) said, 'This is what we're writing.'"
