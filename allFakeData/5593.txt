Prince Harry Is House Hunting in Toronto to Live Close to Girlfriend Meghan Markle!

Things just keep getting more and more serious between Prince Harry and his girlfriend, Meghan Markle!

The 32-year-old royal is house hunting in Toronto to be closer to Meghan, 35, according to In Touch Weekly. “He’s looking to rent a love nest for them in Toronto, not far from where she lives now,” a source recently told the magazine.

“Harry wants to find something that is larger than Meghan’s current home and has state-of-the-art security,” the insider revealed.

Meghan currently lives in Toronto because that’s where she films her hit USA TV show, Suits. Though the couple — who began dating in August 2016 — often get together at Harry’s Kensington Palace residence, it would be easier for Harry and Meghan to spend most of their time in Canada, outside of the royal spotlight.

“Eventually, Meghan will move to London. But in the meantime, Harry

wants her to live like a princess,” the source said.

Interestingly, the actress has a knack for interior decorating, so Harry wants Meghan to take care of sprucing up their new space! “She’s got great taste when it comes to interior design, so Harry has no problem leaving it up to her,” the insider continued.
