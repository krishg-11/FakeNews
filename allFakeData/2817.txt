Jennifer Lopez *Specifically* Requested Milo Ventimiglia as Her Love Interest in Her Movie

Milo Ventimiglia: America's dreamiest spouse. Jennifer Lopez: the queen of everything. Put them together, and you get the ultimate power couple in the new J Lo-produced movie Second Act. Milo recently appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, where he discussed the upcoming movie and what it's like to be Jennifer's onscreen love interest (sorry, ARod, Jack Pearson's got it from here).

To no one's surprise, Milo revealed that Jennifer actually requested him specifically to play her boyfriend in the movie because she loves This Is Us. Gosh, we have so much in common! "She's a pro, she's so cool, she's got the heart of an artist, and very giving with her time," Milo said. We can't wait to see how his onscreen relationship with J Lo compares with his picture-perfect onscreen romance with Mandy Moore on This Is Us.

Watch the clip above to see Milo and Jimmy rave over why Jennifer is "the greatest," then catch up on all the details about their new movie Second Act, out this Thanksgiving.
