President West? Kanye Builds His Own Oval Office Replica Inside New California Mansion

There’s nothing like some do it yourself work to help you visualize the big picture. It looks like Kanye West will not stop at anything when it comes to reaching his dreams.

Is that a way for the rapper to tell his loyal followers that he will be running for president?

We have learned that the man is currently doing some serious renovations at his and Kim K’s huge mansion in California.

We all know that the rapper has a massive ego, but that is not even equaled by the size of his bank accounts.

That being said, sources have told us that Kanye called in a team and asked them to build an Oval Office just for him at home, because why not?

As for the interior design of the office, while it will pretty much replicate the original White House one, the vibe will be different.

Kanye West’s Oval Office will be less ‘stuffy’ looking and will channel more of the rapper’s personality and his expensive taste.

As fans may already be aware, Kanye and Kim’s relationship hasn’t been the best lately, and insiders claim they are sleeping in separate beds.
