Jessica Simpson and Ashlee Simpson have been immortalized in the fine arts.

The songstress sisters acted as muses – and models — in dad Joe Simpson’s first art show titled “Dreams Work,” which showcases the former music manager’s collection of original photographs.

While sipping from flutes of Freixenet cava, Simpson’s friends and family – including both his daughters and their husbands Evan Ross (wed to Ashlee) and Eric Johnson (married to Jessica) – fêted the 58-year-old with a gallery opening Sunday at the Bruce Lurie Gallery in Culver City, Calif.

Ranging in price from $500 to $5000, the collection of 50 digitally enhanced portraits also includes never-before-seen images of Ashlee’s son Bronx, 7, and Jessica’s daughter Maxwell, 4, and son Ace, 2, with 10% of proceeds benefitting Adopt the Arts Foundation.

“Jessica said she would not have missed the opening for anything and she’s always believed in her dad,” an insider told Page Six. “She’s so happy and proud.”
