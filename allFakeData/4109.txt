Diet Dilemma! Katie Holmes Demands Jamie Foxx Give Up Junk Food Now that they've gone public, the actress has laid down the law.

Katie Holmes won’t take any more of Jamie Foxx’s bad habits! RadarOnline.com has learned the health-conscious actress told her junk food-loving boyfriend that his obsession with fatty snacks has got to go.

“When she first started dating Jamie, he made it seem like he was healthy, too, and a nature lover,” an insider told Radar. “The truth soon came out – he’s a candy bar-eating closet junkie.”

Meanwhile, Holmes, 39, is the epitome of good health, and works hard to keep her thin frame. She is a big fan of cycling and yoga, and has even run in the New York City Marathon.

“Katie runs a minimum of three hours a week on the treadmill and she’s athletic to the bone,” the insider added.

Holmes and Foxx, 50, were first linked to each other back in 2013, a year after her high profile divorce from Tom Cruise. They spent years hiding their love, but since going public with their relationship last August, Holmes has dropped the hammer down on the Ray star.

“She’s banned him from eating that stuff, but she’s caught him hoarding cookies and pickles and ketchup for his burgers,” the source added.

The insider insisted that no matter how hard Holmes’ tactics may seem, she’s really only doing it for Foxx’s own good.

“She worries about him,” the source concluded. “After all, he’s 50!”
