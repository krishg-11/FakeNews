Kylie Jenner Reportedly Turned Down A Proposal From Travis Scott

However, the 20-year-old reportedly turned him down. A source told the publication, "Kylie definitely wants to marry Travis, but she also really loves how things are the way they are. She knows she rushed into this relationship, so she's trying to slow it all down and enjoy every single stage."

The source also revealed that Kylie's decision to say no was highly influenced by sister Khloe Kardashian's advice, "She gets lots of guidance from Khloe who is encouraging her to wait on the whole wedding thing."

And added that the rest of Kylie's older sisters echo Khloe's feelings. "It's not just Khloe, all of Kylie's sisters are encouraging her to take her time as much as she can," the source explained.

It seems we might have to wait a while before hearing any Jenner-Scott wedding bells.
