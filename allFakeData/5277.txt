Kim Kardashian Baby Name Shocker! Star Fights With Pregnant Kylie Over What To Call Daughter

Kim Kardashian Baby Name Shocker! Star Fights With Pregnant Kylie Over What To Call Daughter Find out what the new mom of three has chosen for a moniker.

What’s in a name? Turns out a major fight, if you’re Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner!

RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned Kardashian — who just welcomed her 7 lb. 6 oz. baby girl via surrogate last night — and her 20-year-old pregnant sister had been battling over who gets to name their newborn daughter Love!

“Kim and Kylie were fighting over the name,” a source revealed.

While Jenner “also likes the name Princess,” the source noted Kardashian, 37, “was learning toward Star, and will likely let Kylie have Love.”

Never one to give up creative control, Kardashian’s husband, Kanye West, 40, wanted a say in what to call his little girl.

“Kanye wanted South West,” said the source. “But Kim said no because she thinks it’s cheesy and bad for their brand.”

What do you think Kylie and Kim should name their babies? Weigh in with your ideas in the comments.
