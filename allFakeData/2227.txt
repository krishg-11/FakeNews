Mila Kunis Says She and Ex Macaulay Culkin Aren't as "Friendly" as They Could Be

Mila Kunis just opened up about her relationship with Macaulay Culkin for the second time in as many weeks. On an episode of the WTF With Marc Maron podcast, she said they aren't really friends anymore.

“[We’re] probably not as friendly as we could be, no,” she said. “There are too many aspects of it that just prevented us from ever moving forward [from the] past. We dated from when I was, like, 18, 19 until 25ish.”

Last week, during an episode of Dax Shepherd's podcast, she implied that her breakup with Macaulay was mostly her fault.

“And it’s f*cked up what I did," she said. "It’s f*cked up what I did and it’s f*cked up how I did it. When I got to be single I said, ‘I just need to figure myself out.’ I genuinely need to know why I did what I did, and, like, regroup myself as a human being.”

She didn't say exactly what happened, but she did say that she was a "d*ck" during their breakup, which could explain why they're no longer friends. Although, she also said their friends have forgiven her for what happened (whatever that is).

“You know, it’s been so long like I feel like enough time has gone by,” Mila said. “I think enough mutual friends have been like, everybody kind of forgave everybody for what went down.”



Since their split, they've both started seeing (and marrying) other people. Mila and Ashton Kutcher have been married since 2015 and Macaulay is currently dating Brenda Song.
