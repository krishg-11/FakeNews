Swit-swoo! Someone's looking hawt after their post-break-up make-over!

Gone are the bad jeans and the 'Mummy tops'. Newly-single Katie Holmes had a whole new look when she went out for dinner last night.

And we like it!



Wearing a sexy black leather jacket and an elegant green maxi-dress, all glammed up with a boxy clutch-bag, Katie looked the best we've seen her for ages.

Single life obviously suits her.

Katie met her mystery friend for dinner at trendy restaurant Nomad in New York.

And even gave him a peck on the cheek as he put her in a taxi at the end of the night.

He was wearing a wedding ring though, so we're guessing they're just mates.

But still, it's nice to get taken out for dinner and stuff.

It looks like an episode of Sex and The City - and Katie would SO be Charlotte.

Katie was due to make her first red-carpet appearance post-divorce tonight at the Dizzy Feet Foundation gala in LA, but she decided to pull out.

Probably so she could go on more fun date nights in New York.

But if Katie's had a glam-over, six-year-old Suri is taking a back-seat in the fashion stakes.

She took a break from the designer frocks and heels and went out in, um, a blanket the other day.

You can read about that here if you so wish.
