Princess Bride? Khloe Desperate To Get Married At Windsor Castle! Kardashian inspired by Harry and Meghan's 'spectacular' ceremony.

Is Khloe Kardashian trying to upstage new princess Meghan Markle?

On the latest episode of the popular podcast Straight Shuter!, host Rob Shuter reveals the reality star’s desperate to literally follow in Markle’s footsteps .

“Like everybody else, Khloe watched the royal wedding on TV and thought it was spectacular,” a source told Shuter. “She is now eyeing up Windsor Castle as a place for her to say ‘I do.'”

According to the source, while Kardashian, 33, loved the gospel choir and reverend, she was especially smitten with the sleek May event and now “wants to get her hands on” Prince Harry and Markle’s production company for her special day.

Unfortunately for Kardashian, her dream of walking down the aisle at St George’s Chapel is a long shot since she would have to get permission directly from the Queen of England.

Still, Kardashian may want to figure out the state of her relationship with her cheating baby daddy, Tristan Thompson, 27, before she sends out any save-the-date cards!
