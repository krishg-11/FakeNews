Hold Up, Is Caitlyn Jenner Adopting a Baby?!

Is that the pitter-patter of tiny footsteps we hear in the distance? Now that Caitlyn Jenner is finally living life as her authentic self, word has it the reality star is planning to expand her family by adopting a new baby…

Caitlyn Jenner may already be the parent of six kids and six grandchildren, but it seems like she still has baby on the brain. The 68-year-old is said to be thinking about adopting a baby with rumored girlfriend Sophia Hutchins. According to Radar Online, the Olympic gold medalist’s gal pal has been “begging” for a child — and Caitlyn hasn’t necessarily turned down the idea to grow her brood once again.
