Why did Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber break up?

Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez have ended their relationship once again, at least temporarily.

Reports have surfaced suggesting that the pair, who reunited in 2017 after nearly five years apart that was plagued with reconciliation rumors, are taking some time for themselves.

On March 11, 2018, Us Weekly reported that multiple sources confirmed the news of their split.

Rumors are swirling about the reasons for Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber's recent breakup

In addition to various reports about Justin and Selena's breakup itself, a number of different theories about their reason for taking time apart have surfaced. None have been confirmed by either pop star, but that's done little to quell the chatter among their respective fan bases.

So why did Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez call it quits this time?

Selena Gomez's mom, Mandy Teefey

During their second go at love, countless outlets reported that Selena Gomez's mom, Mandy Teefey, was less than thrilled that her daughter had decided to give supposedly-reformed bad boy Justin Bieber another chance.

Those theories have picked up steam in the wake of their alleged split.

A source told Us Weekly: 'It's been hard for her because she is super close with her mom. Her mom was her rock when she was having her health complications.'

However, People magazine's sources have refuted these claims.

'They have their own issues and are always on and off. She wouldn't base her relationship off what her mom thinks,' a source said.

Selena Gomez's family

It's not just Mandy that's not on board with the Biebs. According to Us, Selena Gomez's entire family had qualms about her and Justin Bieber getting back together.

The source said: 'Justin's family loves Selena, but Selena's family has put her in a very conflicting spot because they still don't trust Justin.

'Selena has tried to convince her family that Justin has changed...but her family just isn't budging right now.'

E! shared a similar report, claiming 'family pressure' and other issues led to their breakup.

'She's on a break with Justin partly because of family pressure but also because of some issues surrounding his birthday,' a source said.

'She wanted to have a quiet birthday celebration with Justin and he wanted to go big and involve all of his church friends. They had a disagreement that didn't end well.'

jelena is fine. they hate the media and are doing everything they can to avoid it. and there’s nothing wrong with that because they have nothing to prove to anyone. stop being so negative and good night �� — . (@biebsftlife) March 15, 2018

Justin Bieber's attitude

Amid rumors that Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber called it quits, Us reported that Justin's attitude may have been a contributing factor in the demise of their rekindled romance.

'[He] doesn't care about anyone but himself,' a source said.

'The second she saw it, she walked away, especially now with her health. She knows she doesn't need him.'

Infidelity

A rumor is swirling among Justin and Selena fans on Twitter that Justin was unfaithful to Selena. Some seem to believe the once-troubled singer had something going on with Petra Collins, whom Selena recently unfollowed on Instagram.

That rumor hasn't been substantiated, however. Especially considering it appears Petra is spending time with newly-single Justin Theroux.

They didn't break up

While many outlets are reporting that Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber have definitely decided to take some time apart, others claim they're still going strong.

Entertainment Tonight maintains the duo are still dating, but that Selena is taking a little time for herself to avoid outside pressure that stems from all the attention the two get.

A source said: 'Selena is very delicate; her "comeback" to the spotlight has been tough — especially with the interest in her personal life with Justin and her mother.

'She is taking time to herself. This is not the first time she has done this.'

The insider added: 'She wants to repair her relationship with her mother, that's a priority for her, too. She needs to figure out how to live the life she wants in the spotlight — if that's even possible.'

This theory appears to be popular among fans of both Justin and Selena, who believe they're still together but are in hiding. Some tweeters seem to think the couple simply don't like the media circus surrounding their relationship, so they're laying low.

This theory does seemingly hold up, as both Justin and Selena have complained about paparazzi attention in the past.

Will Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber get back together?

A recent report from People magazine suggests that reconciliation is imminent for Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber. Their sources say fans should expect to see that sooner, rather than later.

'They've been having disagreements, but it wouldn't be surprising if they're back together in a week,' the Jelena insider said.

Similarly, E! reported that this is 'likely not the end' for Selena and Justin.

A source said: '[Selena] wanted some time to clear her head and get away before figuring out what's coming next.'

Another added: 'They will absolutely get back together and they are not over, but they both need some time away from each other.'

Justin Bieber-Selena Gomez relationship history

Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez have a long, somewhat-sordid history that dates back to about 2010.

The pair, who met in 2009, were spotted out together sharing a meal at a Philadelphia IHOP in 2010, which prompted rumors about the status of their relationship.

At the time, Selena told Us: 'It was just pancakes!'

Not long after that sighting, Selena and Justin were seen looking couple-like at a concert in Miami, however, Justin told MTV he was 'just having fun being a teenager'.

In January 2011, things between Justin and Selena heated up and they were seen locking lips during a vacation in St. Lucia.

The following month they were photographed together during Vanity Fair's Oscars after-party in Hollywood, California. They held hands at the event, essentially confirming that they were a couple.

In September 2011, Justin rented out the Staples Center for just himself and Selena. The pair enjoyed a private screening of Titanic. Afterward, Justin tweeted: 'Romance isn't dead.'

For Valentine's Day in 2012, Justin gifted Selena with a ring bearing a diamond encrusted J, which she proudly showed off on Twitter.

In April of that same year, the couple was caught on kiss cam while enjoying a Lakers game together. They pair obliged, but Selena later told Ryan Seacrest it was 'the most humiliating thing'.

Their love story came to a screeching halt in November 2012. The pair reportedly decided to take some time apart due to 'busy schedules'.

Rumors began swirling about them again in April 2013, when Justin shared a photo of himself shirtless in bed being snuggled by Selena.

The following month they were seen sharing a kiss, while Selena's gal pal Taylor Swift looked on in disgust.

Social media remained rife with speculation about the pair, who were later spotted by TMZ taking a Segway cruise around Calabasas, California, together.

Selena and Justin both dated other people while broken up, but eventually found their way back to one another.
