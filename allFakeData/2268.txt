Portia de Rossi Opens Up to Ellen About Why She Quit Acting: "I Decided to Start a Business"

Portia de Rossi made an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Tuesday and confirmed that she has quit acting for good. Sitting down with her wife for the honest chat, Portia confessed that she originally made the decision 18 months ago, explaining, "I kind of knew what acting would look like for me for the next 10, 20 years, so I decided to quit and start a business."

Portia de Rossi made an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Tuesday and confirmed that she has quit acting for good. Sitting down with her wife for the honest chat, Portia confessed that she originally made the decision 18 months ago, explaining, "I kind of knew what acting would look like for me for the next 10, 20 years, so I decided to quit and start a business." However, though Shonda Rhimes promptly wrote her character out of Scandal, the folks over at Arrested Development clearly had a harder time letting go!

Portia confirmed that she will, in fact, appear in a number of episodes of the upcoming season five. After that, it really does look like we'll say goodbye to Lindsay Bluth FÃ¼nke for good, but her colleagues weren't going to let her go without a celebration. Portia's friends at Arrested Development delivered a very special (and incredibly generous) gift to her and Ellen live on the show, and the sweet reaction from the pair to this surprise gift just has to be seen!
