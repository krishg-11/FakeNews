Robert Pattinson ABANDONS Former Friends & Is Over The Party Lifestyle

“I just got wasted the whole time,” he revealed during an interview with The Times. “You feel insane, but I think the studio cut my days because I started speaking total gibberish. Became a total liability.”

But now, according to a source, Robert is back on the straight and narrow, thanks to his fiancé FKA Twigs.

The insider tells OK! “Rob was basically a 24-hour pot smoker back in his Twilight days, but since his relationship with Twigs got serious he's scaled back on all his vices and hardly ever drinks or smokes around other people.”

If Robert drank due to being stressed with the fame of Twilight, we can only imagine what happened after those infamous photos of Kristen Stewart making out with her movie producer boss while they were still together did to him.

"He's matured a lot and become this very serious young man,” adds the source. “Rob’s dismayed that Charlie [Hunnam] hasn’t given up his pot habit. He doesn’t want to hang out with him, or his other hard-partying friends like Tom Sturridge or Eddie Redmayne.”

But we haven’t heard anything negative about FKA Twigs since they started dating in 2014, so it sounds like having a low-profile and more mature partner is exactly what he needed to turn his life around!
