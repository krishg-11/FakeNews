Jonah Hill and Emma Stone reunite in Netflix's 'Maniac,' which looks nothing like 'Superbad'

Jonah Hill and Emma Stone played high school sweethearts more than a decade ago in Greg Mottola's 2007 comedy, Superbad. Now they're reuniting on screen for the first time since then in a new Netflix limited series from Beasts of No Nation director Cary Fukunaga.

In Maniac, Hill and Stone star as Owen Milgrim and Annie Landsberg, respectively. The two choose to participate in some kind of mysterious pharmaceutical trial for a drug that purports to fix any troubles of the mind.

The 10-episode story is based on a Norwegian TV series of the same name, and it comes to Netflix on Sept. 21. This trailer doesn't reveal much, but it definitely sets a mood.
