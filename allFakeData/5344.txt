Gigi Hadid warns Anwar Hadid about Kendall Jenner

Video footage emerged just yesterday of Kendall kissing Anwar while at the CDFA Awards after-party, which not only made us applaud her efforts, but also kind of creeped us out since they're semi-related.

But each to their own.

The one thing we kept wondering is, how does Kendall's best friend Gigi feel about this?

Well, she isn't happy.

“Gigi is giving her little brother a warning,” the source has revealed. “ She told him that Kendall is a heartbreaker, and not to fall in love with her. Gigi knows that Kendall puts work and her career first with little time for a serious boyfriend or a long term relationship. So Gigi has made it clear to Anwar that while Kendall is a beautiful, sweet, smart, sexy, and a trusted friend, she is not to be messed with.”

It's true, since Kendall was just seen on a romantic date with NBA star Ben Simmons only a few days earlier.

However, Anwar “has had a crush on Kendall for years. Gigi fears her younger brother will fall in love with Kendall after one kiss so she told him to slow down.”

All we can do is watch this space!
