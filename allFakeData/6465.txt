Meghan Markle and Prince Harryâ€™s new year baby plans

Based in a clinic just a stone's throw from Kensington Palace, Melanie specialises in fertility, pregnancy and preconception nutrition.

But there was one particular visitor who raised eyebrows when she called in on 36-year-old Meghan at her new home - nutritionist Melanie Brown.

As Meghan Markle moved into Nottingham Cottage after her engagement to Prince Harry, she was deluged with deliveries, well-wishes and guests dropping by to welcome her to the fold.

And palace sources say they want to be in tiptop shape to fall pregnant as soon as possible after their wedding.

"Melanie was at Nottingham Cottage for around an hour checking Meghan's vitals, looking into her health history and taking as much information as possible to devise a specialist diet for both her and Harry to stick to," a palace source tells Woman's Day exclusively.

"While Meghan's hoping she won't have problems conceiving when they start trying for a family, she's also aware she'll be almost 37 by the time she does," says our insider.
