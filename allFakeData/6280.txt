Twilight Saga movie props are going up for auction

Twi-hards, you're in luck: an auction to celebrate a special anniversary in the Twilight series is offering up hundreds of items from the movie set that you can add to your own fan collection.

Over 600 props, costumes and other memorabilia from the set of the Twilight Saga films are now available for bidding online at Prop Store.

The selection includes a wide range of fan-favorite collectibles that feature prominently in some of the most memorable moments of the series, from the set of bases used in the Cullen family's baseball game to Bella's personal copy of Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights to Bella and Edward's wedding invitation.

There are costume items to bid on that have been worn by a variety of characters, including Jasper and Rosalie Hale, Jacob Black and Dr. Carlisle Cullen. And, if you're looking for just the right accent piece in your home, you can bid on set decor that once graced the halls of the Cullen household.

Last year, several other items (including Bella's wedding ring) were offered up for fans to bid on - but this appears to be one of the biggest prop auctions for the Twilight franchise yet.

The Twilight Saga online auction will be held from November 6 - 17.
