Jessica Simpson Is Pregnant Again — Report

The ‘Fashion Star’ host is pregnant with her second baby, according to a new report! Jessica and her fiance are expecting another bundle of joy just months after welcoming Maxwell Drew in May — read on for the exclusive details.

Jessica Simpson is reportedly pregnant again! The fashion designer is set to welcome her second child with fiance Eric Johnson, according to Us Weekly — less than seven months after welcoming daughter Maxwell Drew Johnson in May!

“It definitely wasn’t planned. But yes, Jessica is pregnant again,” a source told Us Weekly.

Even though she has been working hard to shed all of her baby weight — very publicly, thanks to her deal with Weight Watchers — the source said Jessica, 32, is so excited to welcome another bundle of joy with Eric, 33, whom she’s been engaged to for two years.

“She really is overjoyed!” the source added.

“I will not be commenting on this speculation,” Jessica’s rep told HollyBaby.com EXCLUSIVELY — doesn’t sound like a denial!
