The roles these actors & actresses *nearly* played

Olivia Wilde could have been in Wolf of Wall Street but she reportedly missed out on the role because she was "too old". Cue shocked faces all round. The 32-year-old went on The Howard Stern Show and was asked if she ever missed out on a part because she was too beautiful.

"The funniest thing I heard recently was, I heard that I was too sophisticated [for the part]. I thought, 'oh, that sounds nice. I like that feedback. I didn't get the part but I'm a very sophisticated person.'" she continued. "And then I found out later they actually said old."

Olivia insisted the woman who beat her out for the part did a great job: "I thought she kicked so much ass in that movie." She also had no trouble finding a silver lining about being passed over. "It shows that if you don't get somethingâ€¦ it might lead to something else," she said.

It's not confirmed whether it was Margot's role, but it certainly looks that way as there aren't that many female parts in the movie.
