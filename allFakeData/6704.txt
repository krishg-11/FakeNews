Kylie Jenner Reportedly An Emotional Wreck Following Caitlyn Jenner’s Transition

Kylie Jenner Reportedly An Emotional Wreck Following Caitlyn Jenner’s Transition

Not all of Caitlyn Jenner‘s kids are dealing with her transition gracefully.

While the world has been on an inspiration high since Jenner’s AMAZING speech at the July 15 ESPYS, Kylie Jenner is reportedly not as thrilled. According to a source, Kylie has felt more “alone” than ever following Cait’s change.

A source explained:

“Kylie has not been taking this whole thing well at all and cannot come to terms with the fact that her father is now Caitlyn.”

Hmm. Considering the youngest Jenner didn’t show up to a recent Father’s Day event, we’re not surprised to learn she’s feeling this way.

The insider added:

“Caitlyn has been getting more attention than anyone in the family and perhaps that is part of what bothers Kylie. But also she feels incredibly alone lately and is barely coping. She used to be daddy’s girl but ever since her dad transitioned, Caitlyn does not seem to have the same time for Kylie that Bruce once did. It bothers her a lot and last night while everyone in the family was crying tears of joy, her tears were of sorrow.”

We can understand why the 17-year-old is feeling left out — the 65-year-old is more in demand than ever! Long gone are the days that the Olympian was chauffeuring Kylie and Kendall Jenner around Calabasas!

We just hope Kyles will eventually come around to Caitlyn…we know there’s a lot of love there. Hang in there, you guys!
