Brad Pitt: My twelve years of hell with Angelina Jolie

The outrageous Star magazine cover story that has shocked America Star magazine (US)

The Fury star has been separated from the Oscar winner for a year now - although their divorce is not finalised – and even though they were together so long and became parents to six kids, he has concluded they were never a great fit for each other, according to US publication Star.

An insider told Star: “In hindsight, they really had nothing in common besides great sex. He’s sat up many nights going over what happened, and he’s analysed it again and again in therapy. He realises his relationship with Angie was toxic from the start.”

Brad has reportedly admitted he drank too much while married to Angelina and that their hectic schedules and responsibilities as parents drove them apart.

The source added: “Brad’s demons got a hold of him … Ange used to be so exciting. But by the time they had six kids, Ange was so tired that Brad’s needs were put on the back burner.”

Brad Pitt has yet to publicly respond to Star's sensational allegations.
