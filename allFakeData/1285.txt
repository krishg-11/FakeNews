Tulsa School closes after brutal fire.

Santa Clause not delivering joy this year Sorry kids. If you were hoping to find some of your favorite toys under the Christmas tree this year, you are going to be disappointed. For the first time in history, Santa will not be making his rounds on Christmas Eve. According to an anonymous Elf we spoke to at the North Pole, Santa is keeping the news from everyone for fear of causing disappointment. Why would Santa stop delivering toys to the good little boys and girls after SO many years? Many people upon hearing the news are asking themselves that very question. The truth is we do not know and if Santa doesn't speak up soon, December 25th may come and go with no one quite understanding. One thing is for sure, if the big day arrives and children discover upon waking that Santa has skipped their house, there are likely to be so very sad little kids. Here's hoping the elf we spoke to is mistaken.
