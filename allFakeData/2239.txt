AceShowbiz - %cAnna Faris% is allegedly "furious" at husband %cChris Pratt% after finding him half-naked in his dressing on the set of his new movie. The "Mom" star got angry because her husband was not alone in the room, according to the latest issue of National Enquirer.

The tabloid claimed the jealous Faris was surprised after she walked into his room and caught her barely-dressed husband with a costume girl. An alleged source said Pratt could be heard giggling with the girl, before his angry wife rushed in.

The source further claimed Faris yelled at her husband, "Can't they find a GUY to help you change your jock strap?" The "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2" star "instantly registered a request to producers for male or very ugly female assistants."

Faris' rep, however, says the above story made by National Enquirer is not true. The rep assures fans by telling Gossip Cop that it's "complete nonsense." In fact, the 40-year-old actress didn't catch her half-naked husband in his dressing room with a girl, nor did Pratt ask for male or ugly female assistants.
