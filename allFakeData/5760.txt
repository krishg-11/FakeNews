Celebrities gathered on social media to pray and vent as news broke that the church shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, left at least 26 dead.

“Just nothing. No words. Numb. Again," singer Josh Groban tweeted. “May everyone affected in Texas rest in and find peace.”

Some noted that we've been here before. "My heart hurts," Bob Saget wrote. "This has to stop."

Reese Witherspoon posted, "I'm just so heartbroken over the shooting in #SutherlandSprings Texas. This gun violence must end."

Mark Ruffalo reminded that "We are all in this together."

Others called more explicitly for legislation.

Lady Gaga noted that she was praying "for all the families who are suffering the loss of loved ones" and "I'll pray also for #GunControl."

Stephen King wondered, "How many more have to die before we enact sane gun control laws?"

"When a plane crashes, air travel becomes exponentially safer," Sarah Silverman noted, asking why that doesn't happen after a mass shooting. "Please let's all come together."

Chelsea Handler placed the blame on Republicans.

Brad Paisley, who took the CMA Awards to task for prohibiting questions about the Las Vegas mass shooting and gun rights, tweeted, "God bless you, Texas. #texasstrong."

And Debra Messing simply called for "love."
