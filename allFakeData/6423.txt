Gone Eric Benet: Halle Berry Dumps New Boo Alex Da Kid During Bora Bora Baecation

Halle Berry Dumps Producer Boyfriend During Romantic Getaway

Can’t say we didn’t see this one coming… Another love affair has ended for Halle Berry!

Well to put it more accurately, 51-year-old Halle has called it quits with 35-year-old producer Alex Da Kid. And the way she did it was SO COLD!

According to In Touch reports, Halle broke up with Alex during a romantic vacation to Bora Bora:

“Halle broke up with Alex smack in the middle of their romantic getaway in Bora-Bora,” says a source, explaining that nearly halfway into the trip, Halle realized her five-month romance with the British music producer wasn’t working and had her assistant book her a flight home. “Halle decided he was too young and his communication skills were terrible. She said she needs someone who can think for themselves and is mature, smart and all-around adventurous,” the source explains to In Touch. Adds the source: “The last thing Halle needs is to be in a long-term relationship with a man who doesn’t express himself well.”

Yikes… Do you think he finished out the vacay or nah?
