10 rules Prince William and Kate Middleton must always follow that other royals don't

William had to ask his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, for her consent to marry Kate, according to the Royal Marriages Act 1772, which decrees all descendants of George II must obtain the sovereign’s agreement before they wed, otherwise the marriage is invalid.

In 2013, the traditional Royal Marriages Act was repealed in favor of the Successions to the Crown Act—meaning only the first six in line to the throne require the Queen's permission to marry. William is second in line, so he needs Her Majesty's permission, which she happily gave. (Prince Harry, in case you were wondering, was fifth at the time of his engagement to Meghan Markle, so he needed granny’s approval, too.) And for more wedding rules the monarchy must hew to, learn the 20 traditions royal brides must follow.
