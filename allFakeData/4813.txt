Ruby Rose Opens Up About Health Crisis — And Why We May Be Seeing Her In A Wheelchair

Ruby Rose shared a message with fans on Thursday, taking to Twitter to reveal she’s dealing with a health issue that could result in her being seen in public using a cane or wheelchair.

In order to get ahead of questions before they’re inevitably asked, the DJ, former “Orange Is the New Black” star and “John Wick: Chapter 2” actress shared a photo of herself in a wheelchair and revealed she’s currently on the mend after undergoing a “back procedure” to address an unspecified spine problem she’s been dealing with for a decade.

“So..For the past few years (decade) I’ve been dealing with a spine issue,” writes Rose, 31.

“I am now recovering from a back procedure, but I do need to stay active, so before I get seen with my cane and wheel chair in public, I’d rather put it out there that I’m fine and going to be fine.”

Hey, as one of many disabled folks who sometimes wears braces or needs other assistive devices, thanks for being open about this. It means a lot to have people see that assistive devices give folks autonomy and freedom to go about their day! — Jennifer Kretchmer (@dreamwisp) January 18, 2018

It takes an incredible amount of courage to step forward and show the world your raw form, especially when it gives you so many reasons not to. It is also beautiful. I truly believe that you were given this mountain to show that it can be moved. You’ve got this Dear 💪🏻💜 — Shelley Watson (@A_tallorder) January 18, 2018
