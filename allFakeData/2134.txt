Watch Justin Bieber Awkwardly Explain His Selena Gomez Tattoo and Try Not to Cringe

"The hardest part of breaking up is getting back your stuff."

So said the famed philosophers 2gether. (Google it). Unfortunately, we've now discovered that there is actually something harder than getting your stuff back from an ex. And that is having to explain how you will go about covering up the photo of your former lover that you had permanently inked onto your skin.

Case in point: Justin Bieber explaining some of his tattoos during his photo shoot with GQ magazine. Some of his body art has really deep meaning, and he seems to have a lot of ink dedicated to his mother, which is sweet. But then he gets to a tattoo on his arm that is clearly Selena Gomez and it gets a little awkward.
