Pure Dancing with the Stars

The next 48 hours leading up to the cast announcement are likely to be pretty hectic, so I thought I better get this posted sooner rather than later. Here’s the list of all the cast rumors we’ve heard/reported on for season 24 – as always, they’re divided into categories. Legitimate possibilities are rumors that we think have some validity, based on who is reporting them; long shots are rumors from a source that we don’t necessarily trust, but it’s possible they could be valid; pure randomness is general observations/weird stuff we’ve noticed that may or may not indicate anything, but is interesting nonetheless; wannabes/campaigners are celebs that have expressed interest in doing the show, but we have no reason to believe they’ve actually been asked to do the show; and the definite “no’s” are celebs that have specifically said they won’t do the show.

If anything new crops up between now & the announcement, I’ll do my best to update…but no guarantees. Tomorrow is Fat Tuesday, and I’ve got hella king cakes to get ready 😎
