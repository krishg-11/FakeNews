Travis Scott Pleads Guilty to Disorderly Conduct





Travis Scott has pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct after being arrested during a concert in Arkansas in May 2017 on charges including inciting a riot, Us Weekly confirms.

The 25-year-old rapper’s attorney Jon Nelson tells Us that his client’s case was quietly resolved in January through plea negotiations. Scott (real name Jacques Webster) pleaded guilty to the lowest charge and was required to pay $640 in court-associated costs, in addition to $6,825.31 to two people who said they were injured at the concert. The other two misdemeanor charges — inciting a riot and endangering the welfare of a child — were dismissed.

“Obviously, [Scott] would not in any way want a riot to break out at his concert. That would not be good for him as an entertainer,” Nelson says. “To think that he incited one is ridiculous. We think the police way overcharged him. The prosecutor’s office finally did the right thing — they made an offer that he agreed to. … If anyone was hurt, Travis expressed concern from the beginning. He wanted to make sure those people were taken care of.”

The attorney added that he believes the disorderly conduct charge could eventually be expunged from Scott’s record.

The Rogers Police Department told Us at the time of the arrest that the “Goosebumps” rapper “encouraged people to rush the stage and bypass the security protocols to ensure concertgoer safety.” He was taken into custody at the Benton County Jail and released later in the evening.

The news of Scott’s guilty plea comes just a few days after he became a father with girlfriend Kylie Jenner, who gave birth to the couple’s daughter, Stormi, on Thursday, February 1. A source exclusively told Us that the 20-year-old reality star is “loving starting a family” with Scott, whom she began dating in April 2017.
