Angelina Jolie quits Hollywood for politics

Indeed, throughout the bitter custody battle with Brad, Ange, 42, has always maintained that their six kids – Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and twins Knox and Vivienne, nine – are her top priority. And now that they’re all used to being home-schooled – and are being taught by their separate tutors in subjects from languages to physics – Ange is moving full- speed ahead with her long-held dream of living a political life in London.

She’s spending up big to make it happen. According to insiders, Ange is eyeing up an 18th- century, seven-bedroom property worth a whopping $34 million.

But while the estate boasts standout features like a wine cellar and a media room, it’s all about location, location, location for Ange. The new mansion is just minutes away from the Houses of Parliament in St James’s Park, where residents are influential. Very important people – such as ambassadors and members of parliament – are just the crowd an aspiring politician like Ange would be keen to mingle with.
