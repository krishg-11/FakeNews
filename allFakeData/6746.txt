Here's how Selena Gomez reacted to ex The Weeknd meeting Katy Perry for dinner

Selena Gomez and The Weeknd recently pulled the curtains down on their six-month romance.

While the songstress has reignited her relationship with ex Justin Bieber, the Canadian singer is said to be working on rekindling his love life with Bella Hadid, with whom he split in September 2016 after a year of dating.

Gomez, 25, was recently was pictured kissing Bieber, 23, at a hockey game following their numerous dates, while The Weeknd, 27, was spotted leaving Hadid's (21) apartment on 14 November.

Although The Weeknd (real name Abel Tesfaye) has been trying to reconnect romantically with the model, he sparked dating rumours with a dinner date with Katy Perry, 33, at Madeo in West Hollywood on 20 November.

Gomez reportedly knows about The Weeknd's dinner date with Perry. So, was the songstress down with her former flame having dinner with the Roar hitmaker?

Gomez was said to be "shocked" after coming to know about her former boyfriend's night out with Perry.

"Selena was shocked when she found out about The Weeknd meeting up with Katy Perry for dinner. Selena was a little confused by the randomness of those two meeting," a source told HollywoodLife.

"She was like, 'Really? That's weird,' when she found out about the pair getting together in LA," the source added.

Gomez, however, thinks that nothing is going on between The Weeknd and Perry.

"Selena figures Katy and Abel must be talking about music," the source said, "And would be surprised if the dinner meeting turned into a more romantic relationship."

Gomez could be right about her intuitions as an onlooker told People Magazine, "It wasn't a date — they were with a group of people and they arrived and left separately. They dined on pasta, pizza and steak for three hours. They had intense conversations and everyone seemed to have a great time."
