Drake says he’s victim of ‘fake media story’ saying he asked woman to remove hijab

Toronto’s very own Drake says he was a victim of a “fake media story” after rumours surfaced online that he told a fan to take off her hijab at one of his concerts.

The rapper posted on Instagram that he was talking to four women, one of whom was wearing a winter scarf, and he told her to take it off.

“I make a point every night to end my shows on tones of unity and love, so, to find out that I am being utilized in a fake media story about me disrespecting Muslims is devastating to me,” Drake wrote in the post.

“I am well aware of what a hijab is, and I would never make a disrespectful comment like that in my life towards someone who is wearing one.”

After videos surfaced of the rapper telling the fan to take off the scarf, some called for a boycott his concerts on social media.

Drake wrapped up the post with a call for unity.

“I am proud that my closest friends and fans come from all different religions and races,” Drake continued. “Perhaps whoever made up this story should spend more time learning about other cultures and less time trying to divide us.”

Now, Drake will likely focus his attention to the Grammy Awards this weekend. The Canadian is up for eight awards, including album of the year.
