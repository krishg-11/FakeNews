Christina Aguilera was infatuated with a guy who was into guys.

When discussing the inspiration behind her 2002 song “Infatuation” on “RuPaul’s Drag Race: Untucked” on Thursday, she admitted, “It was heartbreaking because I found out he played for your team, not mine.”

Aguilera, 37, didn’t reveal her muse’s name, but she previously told MTV News that the track was inspired by her ex-boyfriend, dancer Jorge Santos, whom she dated for two years.

After her split from Santos, whom she described as her “first love,” Aguilera married Jordan Bratman, from whom she split in 2010. The “Genie in a Bottle” singer is currently engaged to longtime love Matthew Rutler.

In addition to spilling the tea, Aguilera shared some advice with the aspiring drag performers.

“Once you obtain a certain level of success, you can become jaded and you can see certain people around you change,” she said. “That can make you change and feel guarded or shut down and weird. But I think as long as you keep remembering who you are as a person — and keep remembering the good and the good around you — then nothing can stop you.”
