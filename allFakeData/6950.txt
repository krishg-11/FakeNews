Caitlyn Jenner latest celebrity to float run for office

Story highlights Caitlyn Jenner said she "would look for a senatorial run"

Other celebrities have recently floated political runs

Washington (CNN) Caitlyn Jenner is the latest celebrity to float a run for political office in the age of President Donald Trump.

The Olympic gold medalist who has been an outspoken activist for transgender rights, told radio host John Catsimatidis that she is interested in the "the political side of activism" and "would look for a senatorial run."

"Can I do a better job from the outside?" said Jenner, a lifelong Republican. "Kind of working the perimeter of the political scene, being open to talking to anybody? Or are you better from the inside, and we are in the process of determining that. Yeah, but I would look for a senatorial run."

When asked whether Jenner is seriously considering a run and if she would run as a Republican or an independent, her publicist, Alan Nierob, told CNN Monday that there are "no further details to report at this time."

This comes after wrestling star and actor Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson said that he would consider running for president in 2020, musician Kid Rock insisting last week that his tweet about running for the Senate is no joke and, in perhaps the most viral moment of celebrities exploring a run for office, Kanye West declaring a 2020 presidential bid during his speech at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards.
