The Actors Tipped To Replace Kim Cattrall As Samantha Jones In ‘Sex And The City’

It's no secret that Kim Cattrall has left the Sex And The City franchise for good and now her relationship with her former co-stars is more volatile than ever.

But, if the franchise is to continue without Kim, producers will either have to remove her from the plot entirely, or find a new actor to play Samantha Jones.

An Australian betting company has just released stats that found the common consensus is Kim will more likely be replaced than killed off.

Which prompts the next question, who would (or even could) replace Kim as the fabulously crass publicist?
