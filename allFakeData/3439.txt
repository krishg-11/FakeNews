Goofs

When Fury and the Tiger are trying to outmaneuver each other for firing position, the Tiger gets a shot on Fury's flank that is deflected by the logs on Fury's side. In reality, the logs were mostly useful as protection from shaped-charge weapons like the Panzerfaust. An 88mm shell, especially when fired from such close range, would have shredded the logs, punched through Fury's side armor like it was tinfoil, and probably continued right through the tank and out the other side.
