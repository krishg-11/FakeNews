Golden Globes 2017: Full List Of Winners

'Star Wars' Conundrum: Should Disney Move Their 'Young Han Solo' Film To Christmas?

At tonight's 74th annual Golden Globe Awards, Hollywood's finest have gathered to toast the best in TV and film. Hosted by The Tonight Show's Jimmy Fallon at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles, the night proved to be full of surprises.

Sweeping the movie awards was the critically-acclaimed musical La La Land, which broke the record for most wins by any one film. It won all seven of the categories it was nominated in, including a Best Actor statuette for Ryan Gosling, Best Actress for Emma Stone and Best Director for its auteur Damian Chazelle.

"There was something about these characters and what they're going through that feels very human and natural even in their fantastic circumstances," said Stone backstage, speaking of the Lionsgate movie-musical. "Struggling and falling in love is something I think everybody can relate to in some way."

Heavier fare also won out: the coming-of-age story Moonlight took home Best Picture, one of its six categories, while the August Wilson play adaptation Fences earned a nod for its female lead. "It's not everyday Hollywood thinks of translating a play to screen," said Best Supporting Actress winner Viola Davis of the movie, which grossed $40.7 million at the box office. "It doesn't scream moneymaker, but it does scream art."

On the TV side, The Night Manager took home three awards, more than any other. (The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story, The Crown and Atlanta, each took home two apiece.)
