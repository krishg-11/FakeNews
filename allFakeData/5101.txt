Ellen DeGeneres Real Estate Portfolio

Ellen and wife de Rossi have made a name for themselves as real estate magnates. The couple has a knack for purchasing swanky properties and unloading them to fellow celebrities. For example, they became landlord to musician Nick Jonas in 2015, renting one of their many homes to the 24-year-old.

The couple purchased a mid-century modern Los Angeles mansion in January 2014 for nearly $40 million and promptly sold it to Sean Parker six months later for $55 million. Previously, in May 2012, they sold their 15,000 sq. ft. Beverly Hills compound to Ryan Seacrest for $36.5 million. Ellen and Portia also purchased Brad Pitt’s former Malibu bachelor pad in 2011 for $12 million and sold it to cosmetics entrepreneur Victoria Jackson in 2012 for $13 million.

In March 2006 — prior to her marriage to de Rossi — Ellen sold a home in Hollywood Hills, Calif. to Will Ferrell for $9 million. She also sold former Google CEO Eric Schmidt a California home in 2007 for $20 million, which was later the site of Kim Kardashian’s wedding to Kris Humphries in 2011.

The total number of properties currently owned by the couple is unknown. Ellen released her interior design book “Home” in 2015, which included photos and design tips from many of their past and present residences.
