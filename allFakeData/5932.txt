Elisabeth Moss Secretly Seeing Director Alex Ross Perry

Elisabeth Moss isn’t letting the bastards grind her down! After ending her “extremely traumatic” marriage to Fred Armisen, the Handmaid’s Tale star, 34, is secretly seeing director Alex Ross Perry.

“Elisabeth was terrified of dating after she left Fred, so it helps that she and Alex started off as friends,” says a source close to the Scientologist, who filmed Listen Up Philip and Queen of Earth with the filmmaker, 32. “Alex has been one of Elisabeth’s biggest supporters and a natural confidant. People were pushing for them to hook up from the start, but judging by how inseparable they are these days, it seems to have already happened.” Praise be!
