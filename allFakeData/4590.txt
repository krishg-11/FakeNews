Khloé Kardashian 'wants to marry Tristan Thompson' amid reports she is spending 'quality time in Cleveland'

Khloé Kardashian wants to marry boyfriend Tristan Thompson and focus on their future together, according to reports.

Kardashian welcomed her first child, True, with the NBA star last month just as allegations that he had cheated on her emerged.

While the reality star is yet to make a public statement about Thompson and their relationship, reports suggest they have stayed together and Kardashian even wants to get married “eventually” after spending “quality time” with her family in Cleveland.

A source told PEOPLE: “She seems happier and happier every day. She wants her family to be together. She keeps Tristan on a short leash. He has been very apologetic.

“Khloé wants to get married eventually, but there are no serious wedding talks yet. She does talk about a future with Tristan, though.

“She believes they can figure things out and have a happy life together. True is doing great, too.”

While an insider also told Entertainment Tonight that the 33-year-old plans to spend “another month” in Ohio, having moved to the State shortly before giving birth to her daughter.

They told the publication: “Khloe doesn’t have any immediate plans to head back to LA. As of now, she’s planning on being in Cleveland for another month.

“She’s built a nice, quiet life for herself in Cleveland, which is exactly what she wants right now. She’s really enjoying this quality time with her daughter and Tristan.”

The source added that their newborn has “brought them closer together” and that Kardashian is focussing on her fitness regime and her daughter away from Hollywood.

Standard Online have contacted representatives for Kardashian for comment.

Earlier this week, Kardashian showed off her post-baby body as she worked out in the gym, hitting back at critics who claim she is excersising too much.

In a filtered Snapchat video, she said: “What I'm annoyed about is that I've read a couple of times on Twitter that, you know, they feel that I'm focusing too much on my body.

“But the truth is, I've worked out five or six days a week before I got pregnant and that's my sanctuary and something I love to do.”
