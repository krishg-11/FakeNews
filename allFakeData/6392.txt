Celebrity blog The Blast reported Wednesday that Springfield native Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are continuing to make divorce arrangements, and they've taken steps to keep the discussions out of the public eye for now.

The news was quickly picked up by national outlets such as People.

The Blast reported that both parties recently filed court documents to extend a "temporary judge" oversight period on their divorce case, allowing it to remain private while Pitt and Jolie continue to discuss dividing up assets and custody of their six children.

Currently, the blog reported, Jolie has custody of Maddox, Zahara, Pax, Shiloh and twins Knox and Vivienne. Pitt has visitation rights.

The blog cited anonymous sources who portrayed ongoing talks between Pitt and Jolie as "very amicable."

The two film actors met on the set of "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" in 2003, when Pitt was still married to actor Jennifer Aniston of "Friends" fame.

"Brangelina," as the couple is frequently named in celebrity media, got engaged in 2012, stating they did not plan to marry until same-sex marriage was legal across the United States.

In August 2014, 10 months before same-sex marriages were legal, they married in a surprise ceremony in France, where Jolie has family.

On Nov. 5, 2015 Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt arrive at the premiere of their film "By The Sea" in Los Angeles.

Jolie filed for divorce in September 2016, citing irreconcilable differences.

Brad's younger brother, Doug Pitt, is a Springfield-area entrepreneur who does philanthropic work with local charities such as Care to Learn and international ones such as WorldServe.
