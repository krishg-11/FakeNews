Brad and Ange back together

Hollywood insiders have revealed to OK! USA that the former couple are taking steps to get their marriage back on track.



'They’ve called off their legal attack dogs and are working through the logistics of withdrawing their divorce petitions… They don’t want to throw away the 11 years they spent together,' a source spilled to the magazine.



The pair have been spending more time together ever since Ange, 42, and the kids moved into a mansion just down the road from Brad, 54, making it easier for the Fight Club star to spend more time with their children Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11 and twins Knox and Vivienne, nine.

'Things are so much better among the entire family now,' continues the insider, confessing that Brad is now fully committed to being sober.



'He’s sober and attending weekly therapy sessions. Even with all the drama, he’s come out a better person, and he’s grateful to Angie for kicking him in the pants when he needed it most.'



In fact, the shock split may have been Angie’s plan to get Brad to shape up.



Court documents obtained by the publication show the actress is still signing papers using her married name and that the pair have asked the court to extend the 'temporary judge' in their case so it remains private.



'Brad and Ange clearly don’t want the divorce to be finalised,' pills the source.



'When they’re ready, they plan to request that the court withdraw the divorce petition once and for all.'



In fact, there’s even a secret plan for a vow renewal ceremony once the petitions have been withdrawn!



'It’ll be a spiritual reconnection. Brad wants Maddox to be his best man, as a way to put what happened on that plane to rest once and for all.



'Shiloh and Knox will be in charge of food and music selection. And Zahara and Viv want to help their mum pick out a dress.'
