The wedding looked magical.

Kaley Cuoco is showing more glimpses into her magical wedding to equestrian Karl Cook.

On Monday, the "Big Bang Theory" star shared a preview from her wedding video. Edited by Enjet Media, the clip features footage of the venue, the couple getting ready, and the actual ceremony as voice-overs capture the couple's love.

"When I look at you, the two words that constantly come to mind are 'unconditional love,'" Cuoco, 32, is heard saying.

"There is a rhythm and a pulse to us, like the ocean waves crashing upon the rocks," Cook, 26, says. "And just like those waves on those rocks, we feel like a force of nature. I guess that's the power of a true human connection. If you can't tell, I've loved you since the first night we met."
